41483736,Intracranial activity of antibody-drug conjugates in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: What have we accomplished so far?,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a rapidly evolving class of therapeutics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), offering targeted delivery of cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells while minimizing off-target toxicity. Although ADCs have demonstrated promising results in NSCLC, their efficacy in treating central nervous system (CNS) metastases has been uncertain due to concerns over blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and the lack of dedicated CNS-specific evaluations in clinical trials. However, emerging evidence challenges this paradigm. While earlier-generation ADCs such as T-DM1 exhibited limited CNS efficacy, newer ADCs employing optimized linkers and cytotoxins demonstrate more favorable efficacy and toxicity profiles. Selected agents, including trastuzumab deruxtecan, datopotamab deruxtecan and patritumab deruxtecan, have all shown intracranial responses in patients with advanced NSCLC with brain metastases (BM). Proposed mechanisms facilitating CNS activity include BBB disruption by BM, membrane-permeable and highly potent cytotoxic payloads, and bystander effects that enable tumor cell killing beyond the target antigen. Nevertheless, several limitations remain, including variability in trial designs, limited number of patients with untreated CNS disease, and a lack of CNS-specific endpoints. Given the high incidence of BM in NSCLC and their significant impact on patient outcomes, there is an urgent need to better understand the intracranial activity of ADCs and whether they can prevent the development of CNS metastases, especially as some of these ADCS are being tested in the curative-intent setting. This review synthesizes current evidence and highlights ongoing trials, with a focused examination of the evolving role of ADCs in the management of BM.",2025,Cancer treatment reviews,L1_scientific_engagement
41483728,Effect of quetiapine versus haloperidol on delirium severity in hospitalized adults: A systematic review and meta‑analysis.,"Delirium is a neuropsychiatric condition, characterized by cloudy state of consciousness. Though commonly treated by haloperidol, quetiapine offers its own distinct benefits. A focused systematic review and meta-analysis was performed comparing efficacy of quetiapine with haloperidol in hospitalized adults experiencing delirium. According to PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and Google scholar were systematically searched. Only RCTs comparing quetiapine and haloperidol monotherapies on adult human patients diagnosed with delirium were included, with delirium severity as primary outcome. A random-effects model was employed for data analysis using Review Manager (RevMan). 3 RCTs were identified having 215 patients, with 105 receiving quetiapine and 110 receiving haloperidol (mean age ± SD: 57.25 ± 13.09, males: 57.67 %, mean follow up days ± SD: 5.75 ± 1.89). Pooled analysis showed no statistically significant differences in delirium severity (MD: -0.80, 95 % CI: [-2.05, 0.44], I² = 10 %), mortality (RR: 0.60, 95 % CI: [0.29, 1.27, I² = 0 %], sleep time (MD: 1.59, 95 % CI: [-0.45, 3.63], I² = 77 %) and response rate (RR: 0.89, 95 % CI: [0.51, 1.56], I² = 85 %). This study shows no significant difference in overall effect of quetiapine and haloperidol in delirium management. However, due to paucity of RCTs, limited sample size and high heterogeneity, subsequent research is needed to identify optimal pharmacological interventions for delirium management.",2025,Asian journal of psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement
41483727,"Vision-language models in diagnostic imaging: review of technical advances, clinical validation, and practical deployment.","Radiology faces an unprecedented workload crisis, creating demand for AI solutions to enhance efficiency and quality. Vision-language models (VLMs) represent a paradigm shift from narrow AI tools to integrated systems for image interpretation and report generation. However, their rapid technical progress has outpaced rigorous clinical validation, creating a critical gap between their theoretical potential and safe, practical deployment. To critically review the state of VLMs in diagnostic imaging by evaluating their clinical validation, identifying deployment challenges, and assessing their impact on the radiological workflow. This review provides a roadmap for responsible clinical integration by analyzing the gap between model performance and real-world utility. A narrative review of literature was conducted from January 2017 to May 2025. The search focused on VLM applications in radiology, including automated report generation and visual question answering. We synthesized findings from technical and clinical validation studies, thematically organized around architectural evolution, applications, validation, and implementation barriers. A clear progression from encoder-decoder models to sophisticated LLM-integrated foundation models was identified. While these models achieve high performance on NLP metrics, their clinical utility is limited. Key findings include: (1) Pervasive model hallucination, with factual errors in ∼ 22 % of AI-generated reports; (2) A lack of external validation on diverse, multi-institutional datasets; (3) Significant implementation barriers, including high computational costs, poor workflow integration, and unresolved liability. Human expert evaluations show that while AI-generated reports for routine cases are often acceptable (77.7 % in one study), accuracy declines significantly in complex cases. VLMs hold transformative potential but are not ready for autonomous clinical use. Their primary value lies in augmenting radiologists' workflow. For successful adoption, the field must shift focus from algorithmic metrics to proving clinical safety and efficacy through rigorous validation, developing robust hallucination mitigation strategies, and designing seamless workflow integrations.",2025,International journal of medical informatics,L1_scientific_engagement
41483666,The complexity of dystrophin transcription and processing: implications of transcript imbalance on dystrophin gene targeting strategies.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare genetic disorder affecting male children, characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness. It is a fatal disease, typically leading to death between the ages of 20 and 40, and currently, there is no effective cure. DMD is caused by mutations, most commonly large deletions, in the DMD gene, one of the largest genes in the human genome. This gene also exhibits a distinctive feature known as transcript imbalance, which refers to the unbalance expression of the transcript along its length, with the 5' end being more abundantly expressed than the 3' end. Although transcript imbalance was first described in 1995, it remains a poorly understood phenomenon with many unanswered questions. This review highlights the need for a deeper investigation into transcript imbalance, which has not yet received sufficient attention from the scientific community or from sponsors involved in DMD translational research. Understanding and addressing this phenomenon is critical not only for refining antisense oligonucleotide (AON) therapies and enhancing their therapeutic efficacy, but also for developing innovative strategies that improve DMD transcript targeting and muscle delivery.",2025,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,L1_scientific_engagement
41483580,EEG biomarkers for a precision-medicine approach to noninvasive brain stimulation for major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and disabling condition with high rates of treatment resistance. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), has emerged as a promising option for individuals unresponsive to pharmacotherapy. However, many patients still fail to achieve meaningful improvement, underscoring the need for reliable biomarkers of treatment response. Electroencephalography (EEG) and combined TMS-EEG are increasingly explored as predictive tools because they index cortical excitability, connectivity and neuroplasticity. In this systematic review, we synthesize evidence from 18 high-quality studies evaluating EEG and TMS-EEG biomarkers of NIBS outcomes in MDD. Resting-state EEG studies highlight the relevance of spectral power alterations, frontal alpha asymmetry and connectivity measures, whereas TMS-EEG work emphasizes TMS-evoked potentials, particularly N100 and N45 components, in forecasting clinical response. Although results are encouraging, methodological heterogeneity, modest sample sizes and divergent stimulation protocols limit immediate clinical implementation. Nonetheless, converging findings indicate that pre-treatment EEG and TMS-EEG assessments can support a precision-medicine approach by informing target selection and stimulation parameters. Systematic integration of these neurophysiological markers could enhance personalization of NIBS, increase response rates and advance the development of mechanism-based interventions for depression across diverse patient profiles and clinical settings worldwide.",2025,Psychiatry research.

41483505,The role of phototherapy in pediatric dermatology.,"Phototherapy is one of the widely used therapeutic options in dermatology, and it has proven effective for many dermatological conditions. It includes various modalities such as heliotherapy, broad-band UVB, narrow-band UVB, excimer laser, UVA1, UVA with Psoralens (PUVA), among others. The mechanisms behind phototherapy's efficacy include proapoptotic, immunomodulatory, propigmenting, antifibrotic, and antipruritic effects. In this context, the effectiveness of this modality has been demonstrated in pediatric patients with various conditions; however, no consensus has yet been established regarding its use in this population. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify the most recent studies and advancements in the use of phototherapy in the pediatric population. Phototherapy is a safe and effective therapeutic modality that can be used in multiple conditions, such as psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, pityriasis lichenoides, and actinic prurigo, among others. The therapeutic outcomes depend on the condition being treated, the type of phototherapy used, and the appropriate selection of patients. The phototherapy with NB-UVB is the most commonly use and preferred modality due to its efficacy and lower risk associated. Careful monitoring is recommended to assess long-term safety and optimize pediatric treatment protocols.",2025,Anais brasileiros de dermatologia,L1_scientific_engagement
41483501,"Tirzepatide in dermatology: cutaneous adverse events, emerging therapeutic roles, and cosmetic implications - A comprehensive review.","Tirzepatide, a dual Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Tirzepatide was first approved by the FDA for type 2 diabetes in May 2022 and subsequently for obesity in November 2023, and has demonstrated significant efficacy in glycemic control and weight reduction. Beyond its metabolic benefits, recent evidence highlights its relevance in dermatology. This review explores the dermatologic implications of tirzepatide, including its cutaneous adverse effects, therapeutic potential in inflammatory skin diseases, and cosmetic benefits. Cutaneous side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions, injection-site reactions, and rare severe dermatologic events have been documented. Across the SURPASS clinical trials, injection-site reactions occurred slightly more frequently, comparable to other GLP-1 receptor agonists as semaglutide. Meanwhile, tirzepatide's immunomodulatory properties suggest potential therapeutic roles in conditions like psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa; however, current evidence is limited to case reports and small studies. Additionally, its profound effects on fat distribution raise interest in its cosmetic implications. Tirzepatide's induced rapid weight loss may lead to aesthetic changes, including facial volume loss, which warrants cautious interpretation. This narrative review summarizes current data from clinical trials, case reports, and pharmacovigilance sources, based on a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to May 2025, focusing on skin-related adverse events, therapeutic effects, and cosmetic outcomes of tirzepatide.",2025,Anais brasileiros de dermatologia,L1_scientific_engagement
41483491,Homologous recombination deficiency in endometrial cancer: shedding light on recent clinical findings.,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States, with rising incidence and high recurrence rates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) benefit patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors, but options remain limited for those with mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) disease. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), a genomic instability phenotype, has emerged as a therapeutic target. Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) are being investigated in endometrial cancer, with studies exploring whether HRD predicts response, particularly in combination with ICIs or chemotherapy. This review examines HRD in endometrial cancer, focusing on its molecular basis, clinical implications, and emerging therapeutic strategies. HRD occurs in a sub-set of endometrial cancers, particularly non-endometrioid sub-types, and is linked to genomic instability and platinum sensitivity. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular classification has improved understanding of HRD prevalence across sub-types. HRD testing remains challenging due to a lack of standardization, with current methods including genomic-scar assays, next-generation sequencing, and functional assays. Clinical trials, such as DUO-E and RUBY-2, suggest that PARPi combined with ICIs or chemotherapy may improve outcomes in pMMR tumors, whereas PARPi monotherapy offers limited benefits. Resistance to PARPi is common, driven by the restoration of homologous recombination repair, replication fork stabilization, and drug efflux. HRD is a promising biomarker and therapeutic target in endometrial cancer. Evidence supports the integration of PARPi for select populations, although further research is needed to refine testing, optimize patient selection, and overcome resistance. Future trials should prioritize predictive biomarkers and novel combinations to maximize the benefits of PARPi in HRD endometrial cancer.",2025,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,L1_scientific_engagement
41482263,Role of oral tetracyclines in preventing acneiform rash in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a systematic review.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the current first-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Acneiform rash is a common adverse effect of this treatment, leading to treatment interruption and affecting the patients' quality of life. We conducted a systematic review to assess the role of oral tetracyclines in the prevention of acneiform rash on patients with NSCLC on EGFR TKIs. We conducted a search across Pubmed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases in January 2025. Studies were included if they evaluated prophylactic treatment with oral tetracyclines for acneiform rash in patients with non-small cell lung cancer initiating concomitant epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Two of the 7 selected studies found tetracyclines to reduce all-grade rash - doxycycline (74.2% to 57.2%) and tetracycline (75.6% to 44.5%; p = 0.046). Two found tetracyclines did not reduce all-grade rash but were effective in reducing high-grade rash - doxycycline (19% to 4%; p < 0.001) and minocycline (28% to 12%; p = 0.0455). Single-arm studies reported varying rash incidences rates with minocycline (from 44.8% to 68.3%), inferior to those found in the major trials used for comparison (67% and 77.7%). Oral tetracyclines appear to reduce the incidence of all-grade acneiform rash or, alternatively, to decrease the incidence of high-grade rash. Preventive treatment for acneiform rash at the initiation of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy should therefore be considered. Further controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of oral tetracyclines in preventing acneiform rash.",2025,Actas dermo-sifiliograficas,L1_scientific_engagement
41482234,"Integrating Nuclear Techniques, Isotopic Tracing, Omics, and Artificial Intelligence in Nutritional Systems for Advancing Precision Public Health Nutrition.","Understanding the complex interplay between diet, nutrient metabolism, and chronic disease risk is central to advancing precision public health nutrition. Conventional dietary assessments often fail to capture the biochemical and interindividual variability necessary for mechanistic interpretation and the development of personalized nutritional interventions. Recent advances in nuclear techniques, particularly stable isotope tracing, combined with multi-omics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI), provide a transformative framework for high-resolution nutritional analysis. This review critically synthesized these interdisciplinary innovations, highlighting how the integration of stable isotope methodologies, omics platforms-including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics-and AI-driven data analytics enables dynamic, quantitative mapping of nutrient metabolism and gene-diet interactions. Stable isotope tracers offer in vivo precision for measuring nutrient absorption, bioavailability, and metabolic fluxes; omics platforms elucidate molecular responses to dietary exposures; and AI enhances data harmonization, causal inference, and predictive modeling. Together, these approaches support biomarker discovery, personalized nutrition, and population-level dietary interventions targeting both malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We propose the Nutritional Systems Integration (NSI) framework, which operationalizes isotope-omics-AI convergence to inform evidence-based, adaptive nutrition policies. This systems-driven paradigm establishes feedback loops connecting research, clinical application, and public health strategy-advancing global goals in food security, health equity, and disease prevention. Embracing such integrative methodologies can transform nutrition science from descriptive epidemiology into predictive, precision-based solutions for sustainable and equitable health outcomes.",2025,The Journal of nutrition,L1_scientific_engagement
41482192,LCK at the Crossroad of Immunodeficiency and Autoimmunity: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.,"The lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) is the principal initiator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and a critical regulator of T-cell development, activation, and immune tolerance. Its critical expression in T cells positions LCK as both a molecular gatekeeper of adaptive immunity and an attractive therapeutic target. Loss-of-function mutations in LCK result in combined immunodeficiency with profound defects in T-cell differentiation and signaling, whereas hypomorphic variants with residual activity can promote immune dysregulation and autoimmunity. Conversely, aberrant LCK activation is associated with autoimmunity and chronic inflammation, including type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, and graft-versus-host disease. Here, we review the structural and regulatory mechanisms of LCK, its dysfunction in immunodeficiency and autoimmunity, and the current landscape of therapeutic strategies. While first-generation inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site have shown efficacy in preclinical models, their lack of selectivity highlights the need for innovative approaches directed at non-catalytic domains of LCK. By linking mechanistic understanding with clinical relevance, we position LCK as a precision regulatory node with the potential to transform therapeutic strategies for T cell-driven immune disorders.",2025,Immunology letters,L1_scientific_engagement

Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the emergence of groundbreaking drug delivery platforms, which offer new avenues for addressing the therapeutic challenges of UC. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the rational design principles underlying UC nanotherapeutics, with a focus on leveraging the unique pathophysiological features of the disease for the development of nanosystems endowed with dual-targeting capabilities and multi-stimulus responsiveness. We also discussed the multifaceted mechanisms of action of these nanotherapies, which extend beyond mere drug delivery to include immunomodulation, gut barrier repair, and gut microbiota remodeling. Furthermore, the challenges in clinical translation are critically evaluated, encompassing biosafety, manufacturing quality, and the preclinical-human gap.

41482167,"Linking Particulate Matter Exposure and Neurological Disorders: Evidence from Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Mechanistic Studies.","Exposure to particulate matter (PM) including fine (PM₂.₅), coarse (PM₁₀), and ultrafine particles (UFPM) has emerged as a critical environmental determinant of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, neurodevelopmental impairments, and cognitive decline. This review integrates evidence from 129 research articles (2002-2025) to elucidate the mechanistic, biomarker-based, and public health dimensions of PM-induced neurotoxicity. Mechanistic pathways include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier disruption, with documented structural and functional damage in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. PM₂.₅ serves as a carrier of neurotoxic metals (e.g., lead, cadmium, vanadium) and understudied organic toxicants (e.g., PAHs, pesticides), amplifying its pathogenic potential. Exposure occurs through the olfactory route, systemic circulation, and gut-brain axis, highlighting multiple entry points into the central nervous system. Biomarkers such as Aβ₄₂, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and α-synuclein are elevated in experimental models, but require greater validation in human PM-exposed populations. Children and older adults represent the most vulnerable groups due to developmental sensitivity and cumulative neuroinflammatory burden, yet remain underrepresented in cohort studies. Geographic disparities further limit generalizability, with low- and middle-income countries underrepresented despite experiencing the highest PM burdens. Future research must advance longitudinal, cohort and life-course studies, multi-omics biomarker discovery, and real-world mixture toxicology to identify intervention targets. These findings call for urgent integration of air pollution control into public health strategies targeting neurological diseases, emphasizing prevention through regulation, early detection, and equity-focused research frameworks.",2025,Neurotoxicology,L1_scientific_engagement
41482142,Pharmacological targeting of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2): a potential strategy to improve the efficacy of oncological photodynamic therapy.,"The recalcitrance of tumors to photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been linked to PDT-induced activation of survival pathways in sublethally afflicted cancer cells that modulate cellular responses to oxidative stress and damage. Survival signaling manifests in regions of the tumor where the tumor cells are insufficiently photosensitized or subjected to inadequate fluence rates. The survival signaling in these tumor regions is believed to account for tumor recurrence. Accordingly, PDT efficacy can be improved by intervening in these pathways using molecular inhibitors of key modulators of survival signaling, thereby reducing the number of sublethality afflicted cancer cells whilst increasing therapeutic efficacy. A promising target for pharmacological intervention is the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) pathway, which induces the antioxidant and xenobiotic stress response that helps cells cope with prolonged periods of hyperoxidative stress after PDT. This review outlines our current understanding of this pathway, how it is activated, and how it confers cytoprotective effects and ensures cell survival. Additional distinguishing features of the review are that (1) studies are addressed in which PDT activation of the NRF2 pathway has been demonstrated; (2) an exhaustive overview of NRF2 pathway inhibitors is presented that could serve as potential adjuvants in PDT regimens to augment therapeutic efficacy in treatment-resistant tumors and cancers that recur after PDT; (3) molecular docking analyses are included that show potential interactions between the NRF2 inhibitors and the redox sensor KEAP1; and (4) an elaborate account is provided on the potential bottlenecks and caveats that can be encountered when using NRF2 inhibitors in the development of fourth-generation photosensitizers for oncological PDT.",2025,Biochemical pharmacology,L1_scientific_engagement
41482134,Is intra-arterial chemotherapy superior to conventional chemotherapy for retinoblastoma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of efficacy and safety.,"Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) has emerged as a targeted alternative to conventional systemic chemotherapy (CC) for retinoblastoma, but their comparative effectiveness and safety remain incompletely defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated whether IAC is superior to CC for survival, globe preservation, and metastasis prevention in pediatric intraocular retinoblastoma. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception to June 1, 2025, for English-language human studies directly comparing IAC with CC and reporting at least one primary outcome. Eligible designs included randomized trials and comparative cohort or observational studies. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane tools, and random-effects models generated pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Twelve comparative studies including 6,261 children and more than 5,000 treated eyes met the criteria. Compared with CC, IAC was associated with higher overall survival (risk ratio 1.12, p < 0.00001) and event-free survival (risk ratio 1.43, p < 0.0001), higher globe salvage (risk ratio 1.33, p < 0.00001), and a lower risk of enucleation (risk ratio 1.69, p < 0.00001), particularly in advanced International Classification of Retinoblastoma Group D and E eyes. IAC also reduced metastatic events by 54% (risk ratio 0.46, p = 0.03). Heterogeneity was low across primary outcomes, and no meaningful publication bias was detected. These findings indicate that IAC provides superior survival, ocular preservation, and metastatic protection compared with CC, supporting its use as a preferred frontline or adjunctive therapy for intraocular retinoblastoma where technical expertise and resources permit.",2025,Survey of ophthalmology,L1_scientific_engagement
41482014,Acupuncture as adjunctive therapy for cervical cancer pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The current study aimed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for pain management in cervical cancer patients through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Databases including the Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched up to January 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating acupuncture combined with conventional treatment versus conventional treatment alone for cervical cancer pain were incorporated. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 16.0 and RevMan 5.4. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed for continuous outcomes. Additionally, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the stability of the results and potential sources of heterogeneity. Eight RCTs involving 627 participants were included in the analysis. A meta-analysis demonstrated that, compared to conventional treatment alone, acupuncture significantly enhanced pain relief as an adjunctive therapy (SMD = -1.00, 95% CI [-1.27, -0.73], p < 0.00001). Manual acupuncture was more effective than electroacupuncture (SMD = -1.25 vs. -0.46). Acupuncture use also significantly improved gastrointestinal function (SMD = -1.57, 95% CI [-3.10, -0.04]) and Karnofsky Performance Scale scores (SMD = 1.28, 95% CI [0.54, 2.02]). The acupoints most commonly utilized were Zusanli (ST36), Hegu (LI4), and Taichong (LR3). Adjunctive acupuncture offers notable advantages in reducing pain and enhancing function in cervical cancer patients, particularly when manual techniques are applied to stimulate specific acupoints.

41481888,The Relationship Between Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and the Prevalence and Clinical Outcomes of Depressive Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The pathophysiology of depressive disorder (DD) has been linked to the inflammatory process, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is considered a marker of systemic inflammation. Increasing research suggests a potential correlation between NLR and DD onset and prognosis. Current literature, however, presents conflicting results, highlighting a need for further investigation. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to September 4, 2024, to identify studies evaluating the relationship between NLR and DD. The primary outcomes pointed to DD prevalence and suicide risk in individuals with DD. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the heterogeneity and robustness of results. Meta-analyses were executed using STATA 15.0 and Review Manager 5.4.1. A total of 37 studies comprising 88,019 participants were included. Categorical analyses showed that high NLR was significantly associated with presence of DD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28, 1.93). Continuous analyses revealed elevated NLR levels in individuals diagnosed with DD (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.94). Furthermore, increased NLR was associated with heightened suicide risk among those with DD (categorical outcome OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.94; continuous outcome SMD: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.61). Elevated NLR is associated with higher prevalence of DD and increased suicide risk in this patient population.

41481872,Functional Spinal Unit Approach for Orthobiologic Injections for Low Back Pain.,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common and complex health issue with a multifactorial origin, involving structures such as the lumbar intervertebral discs (IVDs), facet joints, muscles, ligaments, and nerve roots. Typically, traditional pain management approaches target isolated pain generators. However, recent advancements, particularly regenerative injection techniques, have shifted the focus toward a more comprehensive treatment model that addresses the entire functional spinal unit (FSU), providing a disease-modifying approach. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide a scoping overview of the concept of the FSU and evaluate the potential role of orthobiologics, such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in treating back pain associated with various spinal conditions. Narrative literature review. Relevant peer-reviewed manuscripts were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases, such as PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar. Studies focusing on the anatomy, biomechanics, and pathology of the FSU, as well as those concerning the application of PRP and MSCs in spinal disorders, were included. The FSU, the smallest structural unit of the spine, consists of 2 vertebrae, an IVD, facet joints, and associated supporting ligaments. The FSU is crucial for absorbing shock, distributing mechanical loads, protecting the spinal cord and nerve roots, and maintaining spinal stability and mobility. Orthobiologic therapies, including PRP and MSCs, have shown promise in modulating disease processes and promoting tissue repair in spinal conditions. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of these therapies in reducing pain and improving functional outcomes by targeting multiple components of the FSU. A thorough understanding of the biomechanical processes and the dynamic distribution of mechanical load across its various structures is essential to recognizing that chronic LBP often arises from multiple pain generators rather than a single source. Therefore, an integrated treatment approach that addresses these multiple pain generators collectively, considering the FSU and the entire spine, is critical for optimizing patient outcomes. Rather than being systematic, this narrative review is focused on providing an overview of the effects of orthobiologics in the treatment of chronic LBP using an FSU approach. The heterogeneity of study designs, variability in treatment protocols, and limited long-term data pose challenges in establishing standardized guidelines for orthobiologic therapies in LBP management. Orthobiologic treatments offer a promising disease-modifying approach by addressing the entire FSU rather than isolated pain generators. Future research should focus on optimizing multitarget injection strategies, thereby standardizing treatment protocols.",2025,Pain physician,L1_scientific_engagement
41481871,Lumbar Medial Branch Radiofrequency Ablation: Technical Suggestions Based on Emerging Ex-Vivo Evidence.,"Facetogenic pain accounts for 5-50% of chronic low back pain (CLBP) cases, and the prevalence of this pain increases with age. Because of poor imaging correlation, the diagnosis is challenging and relies on symptoms, exam findings, and ""gold standard"" diagnostic blocks, though optimal protocols remain debated. National societies have issued treatment recommendations for the condition, yet controversy persists. The present investigation focuses on medial branch block radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and highlights key factors for optimizing technique to improve patient outcomes. To demonstrate proper technique and factors that clinicians should consider to maximize the effectiveness of MBN RFA. Development of methodology integrating ex vivo evidence and clinical approach. An academic healthcare institution. A PubMed review of article published between 2020 and 2025 was performed using the keywords ""ex vivo,"" ""radiofrequency ablation,"" and ""lesion size."" RFA of medial branch nerves (MBNs) relies on precise anatomical knowledge to ensure proper needle placement. Recent studies have demonstrated that there are multiple factors to consider in MBN RFA. When compared to muscle, adipose reduces lesion size in relation to lower thermal conductivity. Adipose around the needle decreases lesion size, which may explain the reduced efficacy of RFA in obese patients. Commonly used solutions impact lesion dimensions: 2% lidocaine increases lesional width, while iohexol 240 increases length. In addition, a probe's proximity to bone increases lesion size, as poor thermal conductance traps energy in adjacent tissues. Therefore, shape and size can be modified in accordance with medication selection and the active tip's juxtaposition to tissue. Despite advancements, significant knowledge gaps remain in understanding the effectiveness of RFA, since most studies focus on tumor ablation rather than neurolysis, and lack in-vivo data. To improve real-world clinical outcomes, future research should evaluate functional outcomes and pain relief in patients undergoing individualized procedures tailored to their unique anatomy. RFA of MBNs is a valuable way to treat axial, facetogenic low back pain. The technique should be optimized to best account for the unique anatomy of each patient and thereby maximize the effectiveness of the procedure.",2025,Pain physician,L1_scientific_engagement
41481829,Lung-morphology-guided mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients.,"This review aims to provide an overview of lung morphology classification in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and morphology-guided mechanical ventilation. It discusses the distinct morphological subphenotypes, focal and nonfocal, and how they affect the selection and effectiveness of ventilation strategies. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has traditionally been used to differentiate ARDS morphologies, revealing that focal and nonfocal patterns respond differently to ventilation strategies such as positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration, recruitment maneuvers, and prone positioning. The Lung Imaging for Ventilator Setting (LIVE) trial highlighted the importance of correct morphology classification, showing that misclassification can obscure survival benefits from personalized ventilation. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has recently emerged as a viable, noninvasive tool for identifying morphological subtypes, with multiple classification methods demonstrating high accuracy.

41480812,Local antibiotic prophylaxis in breast reconstruction with breast implants.,"Local antibiotic prophylaxis in breast reconstruction with implants is a widely used method aimed at reducing postoperative infections, biofilm formation, and the incidence of capsular contracture, which can ultimately lead to implant loss, breast implant illness, or breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Currently, there is no convincing guideline or protocol for irrigation, nor a specific antibiotic or combination of antibiotics set. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the existing knowledge on this topic based on available research. A literature review was conducted using the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases / search engines, focusing on local antibiotic prophylaxis in breast implant reconstruction. A total of seven studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected from 79 articles. Across all studies, seven different antibiotic irrigation solutions were compared, involving a total of 2,637 patients. The study findings suggest that local antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing early surgical site infections and capsular contracture. However, the method-ology and study design raise concerns about potential bias and the overall reliability of the results. We believe that this issue remains insufficiently explored and that further high-quality evidence is necessary to establish its efficacy. A clearly defined protocol should be developed and incorporated into official guidelines.",2025,Rozhledy v chirurgii : mesicnik Ceskoslovenske chirurgicke spolecnosti,L1_scientific_engagement
41480778,Association between NT-proBNP and ivabradine in patients after noncardiac surgery: a per-protocol analysis of the PREVENT-MINS study.,"The PREVENT-MINS trial investigated whether perioperative heart rate reduction with ivabradine could prevent myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS). Although ivabradine modestly reduced heart rate, it did not reduce the incidence of MINS in the intention-to-treat analysis. This per-protocol analysis of the PREVENT-MINS trial, with a post-hoc biomarker substudy, evaluated whether perioperative iva-bradine modifies postoperative N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, a marker of perioperative cardiovascular risk. This analysis included 2008 participants who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug, underwent surgery, and had NT-proBNP and troponin measured (ivabradine: n = 1,001; placebo: n = 1,007). Postoperative NT-proBNP levels and changes from baseline (ΔNT-proBNP) were compared by treatment allocation. Clinical outcomes and safety endpoints from the parent trial were evaluated. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) assessed ivabradine's effect on postoperative NT-proBNP after adjustment for baseline values and clinical covariates. MINS occurred in 17.7% of ivabradine-treated vs. 15.7% of placebo patients (RR 1.13; 95% CI: 0.93-1.37; P = 0.23). Median postoperative NT-proBNP was higher with ivabradine than with placebo (418.0 vs. 333.5 pg mL-1; P < 0.001), as were ΔNT-proBNP values (215.1 vs. 154.0 pg mL Ivabradine did not reduce the incidence of MINS and was associated with greater postoperative NT-proBNP release. Perioperative heart rate reduction with ivabradine may elevate markers of cardiac stress without measurable clinical benefit.",2025,Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,L1_scientific_engagement
41480610,Electroacupuncture in glycemic control: Transitioning from clinical controversies to potential basic research.,"Diabetes is a major global metabolic disorder, with the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) population in China expected to reach 168 million by 2050. Electroacupuncture (EA) and auricular acupuncture represent safe, accessible, and multi-targeted strategies for glycemic control with strong translational potential. Clinical studies indicate that EA, targeting trunk and limb acupoints, can significantly reduce fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Mechanistically, EA modulates the neuro-endocrine-immune axis, regulates gut microbiota, and activates insulin signaling pathways. Auricular acupuncture, through vagal innervation, may also exert rapid effects on glucose homeostasis via autonomic modulation. The review's objective is to synthesize and critically evaluate current clinical trials and animal studies on EA and auricular acupuncture for glycemic control in diabetes, particularly T2DM, and to highlight translational implications, mechanistic insights, and evidence gaps. This review also emphasizes translational considerations by highlighting species differences between rodents and humans - an underappreciated yet critical factor influencing the clinical applicability of preclinical findings. Through the integration of recent research advances, the present review not only consolidates clinical and preclinical evidence but also advances a deeper mechanistic framework and underscores the importance of species-specific factors in bridging experimental research and patient care. Future progress requires rigorously designed, adequately powered, multicenter randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols to validate efficacy and define their role in precision diabetes management.",2025,World journal of diabetes,L1_scientific_engagement
41480599,Addressing the dual challenge: Managing smoking cessation in patients with diabetes.,"Smoking increases complications and mortality in people with diabetes. Quitting delivers major benefits, but physiological (weight gain, insulin sensitivity shifts) and psychological barriers make cessation harder in this group. Our review article examined strategies tailored to people with diabetes. All smokers with diabetes should receive clear, personalized advice to quit, embedded in routine care. Among the available medications, varenicline has the strongest evidence in this population. Nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion may help but have limited diabetes-specific data, so they should be used with caution. Tobacco harm reduction (e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products) may facilitate switching away from combustible cigarettes and reduce exposure, although the long-term safety and efficacy in diabetes remain uncertain. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists can aid weight and glycemic control and may indirectly support cessation. Digital tools (apps, wearables, and remote monitoring) offer real-time support and adherence tracking, although diabetes-specific effectiveness is still being established. Smoking cessation in people with diabetes requires urgent attention. Evidence-based interventions should be integrated into routine care, with particular attention given to early monitoring of glucose, body weight, and blood pressure after quitting, plus structured follow-up. More research should develop and test tailored, long-term strategies for this high-risk group, including pragmatic trials integrating harm reduction and digital support.",2025,World journal of diabetes,L1_scientific_engagement

The definitive treatment is still controversial. To assess the efficacy of physical therapy and surgery in improving function and reducing pain levels in patients with LSS, both in the short and long term. This prospective study screened patients aged 50-80 years with LSS and divided them into two groups based on certain criteria: Surgical and conservative. The conservative group received a supervised physical therapy and exercise program for 45 minutes, five days a week, for one month. The surgery group underwent micro endoscopic decompression surgery based on their LSS levels. Assessments, conducted before treatment and at one-month and one-year intervals, included the participants' walking distance, pain level using the visual analog scale, functionality using the Istanbul low back pain disability index (ILBDI) and Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (SSS) Scale, and activities of daily living level using the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living. The study comprised 40 participants, equally divided into surgical and conservative treatment groups, with no significant demographic differences. After one year, both groups exhibited similar changes in walking distance and pain levels. However, the conservative group demonstrated significantly greater improvements in sub-parameters of functional activity and symptom severity of the SSS. After one year, the surgical group showed greater functionality, as assessed by ILBDI, and superior improvement in activities of daily living compared to the conservative group. Both treatments showed comparable efficacy in core outcomes (pain, walking distance). However, complementary advantages were observed: Conservative management demonstrated superior improvement in SSS functional subscales, while surgery yielded greater gains in daily living activities and low-back-pain-related disability.",2025,World journal of orthopedics,L1_scientific_engagement
41480503,"Intertwined roles of microRNA-155 and metformin in osteoarthritis: Novel potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic modulators.","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease characterized by cartilage degradation, synovial inflammation, and subchondral bone remodelling. Despite its increasing prevalence, effective diagnostic, disease-limiting, and therapeutic strategies remain unattainable. Recent studies have recognized the involvement of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the pathogenesis of OA and most of its risk factors while also identifying the antidiabetic drug metformin as a potential modulator of disease progression. MiR-155, a key endogenous regulator of the immune system, mechano-transduction, and multiple genetic pathways, interacts with OA targets of cellular energetic and circadian homeostasis, promoting systemic and local articular inflammation, cartilage matrix degradation, and chondrocyte apoptosis. Metformin, widely used for type 2 diabetes, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and chondroprotective properties in OA, mainly through its activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B signalling. Enthrallingly, metformin targets the same cellular pathways as miR-155 with emerging evidence also suggesting miR-155 expression modulation, indicating synergistic, potentially disease-modifying effects in OA. This review highlights the central role of miR-155 in OA pathophysiology and its potential as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and progression. MiR-155 targeting - through microRNA therapeutics (mimics/antagomiRs) and/or metformin - could pave the way for innovative treatments, including novel articular delivery systems and cell-based therapies.",2025,World journal of orthopedics,L1_scientific_engagement

41480483,Extracellular vesicles in viral disease management.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are non-replicating lipid-bilayered bodies that are naturally released by a cell that aid in various biological functions including cell-to-cell communication. They resemble the cells that they originate from, mimicking their composition and contents. The shared Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) mechanism between virions and EVs allows EVs to aid in the dispersion and infection of viruses. The aim of this review is to encapsulate important studies that highlight the potential use of EVs in diagnosis and therapeutics against viral diseases. It also discusses their benefits and limitations compared to currently available anti-virals, for their use in the medical sector. Virus-infected host cells release extracellular vesicles that are markedly different from EVs secreted by a healthy host cell. Increase in certain biomarker levels in EVs prove to be highly beneficial in diagnostics. Depending on the cell source, EVs also exhibit the natural ability to defend against viral diseases. This innate ability to defend against viral infections, can thus be exploited to produce potent anti-viral responses in infected hosts. By navigating the challenges associated with EVs, they can be utilised to prepare alternatives to anti-viral drugs currently available in the market that show low specificity and high toxicity, thus helping mitigate and manage viral diseases.",2026,Current research in microbial sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

41480395,Novel developments in retinal regeneration: Advances and future outlooks in stem cell therapy.,"Retinal degenerative diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and Stargardt disease, are primary contributors to irreversible vision loss globally. Due to the scarcity of effective curative treatments, stem cell therapy has emerged as a revolutionary advancement in ophthalmology. In the last ten years, significant advancements have been achieved in the derivation of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor precursors from human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, with initial clinical trials indicating safety and potential efficacy. Innovative delivery platforms, such as biodegradable scaffolds, microcarrier suspensions, and minimally invasive subretinal devices, are tackling prior challenges related to cell survival and integration. Simultaneously, gene-edited and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells are positioned to surmount immunological and ethical constraints. Future combinatorial strategies that incorporate stem cells with gene therapy, CRISPR-mediated editing, and bioengineered retinal organoids offer potential for personalized and regenerative methodologies.

41480366,Optical coherence tomography and electroretinography in pituitary macroadenomas: a 12-month analysis by age and tumor type.,"To evaluate longitudinal changes in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and electroretinography (ERG) parameters over 12 months in patients with pituitary macroadenomas, and to assess variation according to age and tumor type. This prospective observational study included 36 patients (72 eyes) with newly diagnosed pituitary macroadenomas. Patients were divided into a treatment group (n=23; including 9 prolactinomas (PRL), and 14 non-functioning adenomas [NFPAs]) and an observation group (n=13; all NFPAs). Both groups were further stratified by age (<60 vs. ≥60 years). Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness was measured by OCT, while functional assessment included photopic negative response (PhNR) amplitude and W-ratio from full-field ERG. Measurements were performed at baseline and 12 months. Comparative and correlation analyses evaluated longitudinal, age-, and tumor-related differences. Mean age did not differ between groups (treatment: 57.4 ± 13.0 years; observation: 54.9 ± 17.2). GCIPL thickness showed no consistent group differences, except temporal thinning in observation patients ≥60 years. RNFL thinning was significant in treated patients ≥60 years (average and inferior/temporal quadrants) and in younger treated patients (<60 years) in the superior and nasal quadrants. Observation patients <60 years showed RNFL loss in average and superior values, whereas no significant RNFL changes occurred in those ≥60 years. PhNR amplitude decreased in treated patients ≥60 years, while W-ratio increased in both treated subgroups and in younger observation patients. Strong structure-function correlations were observed in treated patients ≥60 years, particularly between GCIPL average and PhNR amplitude (R=-0.51) and RNFL superior and PhNR amplitude (R=-0.63). Structural and functional retinal parameters (GCIPL, RNFL, PhNR) may provide supportive information for monitoring visual pathway involvement in pituitary macroadenomas. Differences between PRL and NFPAs were more evident in treated NFPA patients <60 years, suggesting tumor type and age may influence biomarker sensitivity. The absence of such differences in older patients may reflect biological homogeneity or reduced responsiveness of retinal structures. Age should be considered a potential modifier when interpreting OCT and ERG findings across clinical phenotypes of pituitary macroadenomas.",2025,Frontiers in endocrinology,L1_scientific_engagement
41480347,The role of depression in the progression of tumor cell inflammation and the potential regulatory mechanisms of aerobic exercise: a narrative review from molecular and cellular perspectives.,"There is a tight correlation between depression, and tumor progression, particularly via the regulation of the immune system, and inflammatory responses. Chronic inflammation is a member of the core causes in the tumor microenvironment, which can promote tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion. An increasing body of literature has reported that aerobic exercise (AE), as a non-pharmacological intervention, can display potential in anti-tumor therapy by modulating the immune system, delaying chronic inflammation, and increasing neurotransmitter balance. However, it is worth noting that extreme AE may cause negative influences, such as immunosuppression, which influences its anti-tumor efficacy. Our review aims to investigate how depression influences the inflammatory progression of tumor cells via immune regulation, and the potential regulatory processes of AE in this mechanism. Moreover, we further explore the potential of AE in tumor treatment, and delves into its potential deleterious impacts. via this literature review, together with perspectives from molecular, and cellular biology, notably, our review explores the influences of depression, and AE on the tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. It centers on the contribution of AE in modulating immune cell functions, delaying chronic inflammatory responses, and increasing neurotransmitter balance. Depression promotes inflammatory responses in the tumor microenvironment via neurotransmitter imbalance, abnormal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune system dysregulation, hence triggering tumor growth, and metastasis. AE can positively modulate the immune system, decrease inflammation, as well as improve tumor immune surveillance function. Moderate AE modulates immune responses in the tumor microenvironment in the context of enhancing the activity of immune cells, lowering the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and improving the production of anti-inflammatory factors, hence blocking the growth, and spread of tumor cells. However, extreme AE may cause immunosuppression, influencing anti-tumor influences, so individualized changes to the intensity, and frequency of exercise interventions are needed.",2025,Frontiers in psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement
41480344,Clinical prediction models for post-stroke depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a prevalent neuropsychological consequence of stroke, associated with cognitive decline, disability, and increased mortality. Early prediction of PSD is critical for timely interventions and better outcomes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of various clinical prediction models, particularly machine learning methods, in forecasting PSD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate predictive models for post-stroke depression (PSD) using data from 16 studies. The databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, covering publications from the year 2000 to the present. The risk of bias in the predictive models was assessed using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool+AI (PROBAST+AI). The review encompassed both traditional statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. Predictive accuracy was analyzed through the area under the curve (AUC) values of these models, considering various data sources, such as clinical, cognitive, and biomarker data. R packages, including 'metafor,' 'meta,' and 'forestplot,' were used for the analysis. 16 studies were included. Neural Network models yielded the highest pooled AUC (0.88, 95% CI: 0.45-0.98), although this estimate was based on only two studies and exhibited wide confidence intervals. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbor models showed comparable predictive ability, with pooled AUC values ranging from 0.77 to 0.83. Support Vector Machine models demonstrated the lowest predictive performance (AUC = 0.68) but exhibited the lowest heterogeneity. Among different data sources, functional, physical, and cognitive assessments yielded the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.86, 95% CI: [0.81, 0.90]), followed by biomarker-based models (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI: [0.71, 0.86]). Within retrospective studies, biomarker-based data sources demonstrated significantly superior predictive performance (AUC = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96). Machine learning models, particularly Neural Networks, show potential for predicting post-stroke depression, although current evidence is limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Traditional approaches such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models also demonstrate stable and competitive performance. Among data sources, functional, physical, and cognitive assessments provide the strongest predictive value, while biomarker-based models appear particularly effective in retrospective analyses. Despite these findings, the limited number of high-quality studies and methodological inconsistencies highlight the need for rigorous, prospective, and multicenter validation to establish reliable and generalizable predictive models for post-stroke depression. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42025635227.",2025,Frontiers in psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement
41480342,Non-verbal behaviours as predictors for treatment response in patients with depression or schizophrenia: a systematic review.,"Non-verbal behaviours (NVBs) reveal information about mood and emotions, potentially providing an objective means to measure and monitor early treatment responses. Previous research has examined NVB changes during treatment in patients with depression and psychosis but a systematic evaluation of the evidence is lacking. Furthermore, this review could inform the fast moving field of digital and precision psychiatry due to the use of AI-based technology that could transform the potential of NVBs as reliable biomarkers for treatment response. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL were searched in June 2024. Included papers studied adults diagnosed with depression or schizophrenia and measured NVBs at least twice during separate clinical interviews. Outcomes of interest were changes in clinical symptoms and NVBs following treatment initiation. Treatment strategies included hospitalisation, pharmacological, psychological, neuromodulatory, other non-standardised interventions, or a combination of approaches. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The protocol for the review was registered on PROSPERO. 20 papers were identified; 15 on depression, two on schizophrenia and three evaluating both conditions separately. Methodological variations across studies made comparisons challenging. NVBs consistently associated with improvement in depression symptoms included: increased smiling, facial expressivity, and amplified head and body movements. Results across studies were more consistent when considering general categories of behaviour, versus discrete facial behaviours. No commonalities were observed in NVB changes over time for patients with schizophrenia. The existing evidence is presently insufficient to establish distinct behavioural profiles for clinical improvement depression or schizophrenia. Despite implicit challenges, there is considerable future scope in the evaluation of NVBs as predictors of clinical outcomes or change. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, identifier CRD42022368599.",2025,Frontiers in psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement
41480329,Clinical outcomes and drug sustainability after non-medical switch from ustekinumab originator to biosimilars in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Biologic therapies have transformed the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet their high cost poses substantial challenges for healthcare systems. Biosimilars offer a cost-effective alternative, with extensive evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of non-medical switching for infliximab and adalimumab. However, real-world data on ustekinumab biosimilars in IBD remain limited. Given increasing mandates for non-medical switches in Canada, evaluating clinical outcomes is critical to ensure patient safety and treatment sustainability. We hypothesized that switching from originator ustekinumab to a biosimilar would preserve clinical efficacy, safety, and drug persistence in patients with IBD. To evaluate clinical efficacy, treatment persistence, biomarker activity, and adverse events in IBD patients who underwent non-medical biosimilar switching from the ustekinumab originator to a biosimilar. This was an observational study of consecutive IBD patients who underwent a biosimilar switch. Disease activity, biomarkers, drug sustainability, and adverse events were captured 8 weeks before the switch, at the time of switch (baseline), 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after the switch. Of 81 patients were included [85.2% had Crohn's disease, the median age at inclusion: 42 years (interquartile ranges: 29-61)]. Previous biological exposure was 82.7% and a dose optimization of the originator ustekinumab was performed in 63% before the switch. Drug sustainability at 12 weeks and 24 weeks of switch was 96.3% and 95%, regardless of disease type or phenotype. The discontinuation rate was 4.9%. There was no significant difference in the rates of clinical remission at week 8 before switch, baseline, week 12, and 24 after switch: 87%, 85.9%, 84.3%, and 92.7%, Despite prior biologic exposure and frequent dose escalation, switching to ustekinumab biosimilar showed stable efficacy, unchanged biomarkers, and high treatment persistence.",2025,World journal of gastroenterology,L1_scientific_engagement
41480326,Exploring exercise modalities and their impact on inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review of rodent colitis models.,"Lifestyle factors are closely associated with the onset and progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies have demonstrated the positive effects of exercise on clinical outcomes and quality of life in individuals with IBD. Despite the well-documented role of exercise in improving IBD outcomes, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To compare the efficacy of different exercise modalities and explore their potential physiological mechanisms in rodent models of colitis. We conducted a comprehensive search of five databases from inception to September 24, 2024, which yielded 19 animal studies in rodent colitis models. We compared the efficacy of various forms of exercise and explored the possible physiological mechanisms. The effects of different exercise modalities, namely forced treadmill running (FTR), voluntary wheel running (VWR), swimming, climbing, and jumping, on both macroscopic symptoms ( VWR (simulated recreational physical activity), swimming (aerobic exercise), and strength training (climbing and jumping) consistently promoted overall health in animal colitis models. However, evidence for FTR remains inconsistent, with a notable number of studies suggesting potential exacerbation of colitis symptoms, possibly due to stress or fatigue resulting from its coercive nature. Overall, various exercise ( Exercise modality is critical in influencing colitis outcomes, with voluntary and low-stress forms generally being beneficial, while forced exercise may yield adverse effects. These findings highlight the importance of exercise type and individual tolerance in designing therapeutic exercise interventions for IBD.

41480229,Understanding of endo/lysosomal escape of nanomaterials in biomedical application.,"Emerging therapies rely on the efficient and specific delivery of targeted agents into the cytosol, such as DNA, siRNA and proteins. Nanoparticles showed great potentials in safe delivery and transportation of the targeted cargoes; however, the entrapment in endosomes and degradation by specific enzymes in the lysosome hindered the bioavailability, cytosolic delivery and subsequent therapeutic efficacy. In this case, the development of methods for efficient and specific delivery of targeted therapeutic agents focuses on overcoming the major challenge of endo/lysosomal escape, which relies on the development of safe and efficient nano-delivery systems. A deeper mechanistic understanding in the endo/lysosomal escape will guide the development of more efficient nano-delivery systems. In this review, we summarize various mechanisms by which nanoparticles escape from the endo/lysosome, and showcase the recent progress in dissecting the endo/lysosomal approaches based on nano-delivery systems. Emphasis will lie on the properties of nanoparticles that govern the endo/lysosomal escape pathway as well as the latest promising applications in vaccine delivery and genetic engineering field.",2025,Smart molecules : open access,L1_scientific_engagement

While traditional CRC diagnostics and research have focused on nuclear genomic alterations, emerging evidence has highlighted the multifaceted roles of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the pathogenesis and clinical management of CRC. In this review, we examine three interlaced aspects of mtDNA in CRC: (1) Liquid biopsy biomarkers: Cell-free mtDNA circulating in the blood serving as a minimally invasive diagnostic and monitoring tool; (2) Nuclear mtDNA (NUMT)-driven genomic instability: The somatic nuclear incorporation of mtDNA (NUMT segments, or NUMT), contributing to mutational burden and chromosomal disruption in tumours; and (3) Mitochondria-encoded micropeptide signaling - small peptides encoded by the mtDNA that modulate cellular pathways and tumour behaviour. Recent high-impact studies have demonstrated that tumour-derived mtDNA in biofluids can augment cancer detection sensitivity, although technical challenges remain due to mtDNA fragmentation and background noise. Meanwhile, genomic analyses have uncovered a significant increase in NUMT insertion events in CRC cells, linking mitochondrial genome escape to nuclear genome instability and identifying potential numtogenesis suppressor genes. A novel dimension of mito-nuclear interactions in cancer was discovered in mitochondrial microproteins, such as humanin and mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA type-c. Humanin exhibits both tumour-promoting and cytoprotective properties under specific conditions, while mitochondrial open reading frame of the 12S rRNA type-c possesses tumour-suppressive activities under other conditions. The outcomes of clinical, mechanistic, and translational research, revealing how mtDNA-based biomarkers and involvement contribute towards early detection, prognostication, and treatment of CRC, are presented.",2025,World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,L1_scientific_engagement
41480178,Perioperative immunotherapy in gastric cancer in the spotlight.,"Perioperative fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel is currently the standard chemotherapy for resectable gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas, based on the results of FLOT4 and ESOPEC trials. This regimen has demonstrated efficacy in tumor downstaging, enhancing the chances of curative resection, and ultimately improving the overall survival. However, despite these advances, the complete response rate in the perioperative setting remains below 10% to 15%, highlighting the need for more effective treatment strategies. Recent studies evaluating immunotherapy, such as the KEYNOTE-585 trial with pembrolizumab and the MATTERHORN trial with durvalumab, have shown promising preliminary results, including improved response rates and event-free survival.

Retrospective observational study. Patients who underwent EK, including Descemet's stripping automated keratoplasty (DSAEK) and non-Descemet stripping and automated endothelial keratoplasty (nDSAEK) with bullous keratopathy (BK) at Keio University Hospital between 2016 and 2018, were included. Patient characteristics, graft survival rate, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), and complications were compared between the late elderly group (75 years or older) and the younger group (<75 years old) stratified by surgical procedure. Among the 64 eyes and 55 patients who underwent EK, 31 eyes and 30 patients were in the late elderly group (81.4±3.7 years), and 33 eyes and 25 patients were in the younger group (66.2±9.1 years). There was no difference between the groups in terms of the cause of BK, and PBK was more common in the DSAEK group in the late elderly group (p = 0.029). There was no difference in graft survival between the two groups during the follow-up period. In the late elderly group, graft survival was significantly better in the nDSAEK group than in the DSAEK group (p = 0.045). BCVA and postoperative ECD improved in both groups. There were no differences in intraoperative or postoperative complications between the late elderly and younger groups.

41480101,Legacy and impact of the 1925 Geneva Protocol: one hundred years of treaties and debates on chemical and biological weapons.,"This essay examines the legacy and impact of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons. This multinational treaty was an important milestone in the history of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction concluded in the wake of the horror engendered by the use of poison gases in World War I. However, the 1925 protocol did not address the issues of verification, manufacturing, stockpiling, and transferring products of chemical and biological weapons or production technologies. A second treaty, the result of the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, was concluded to address these issues. Despite the apparent success of prohibiting large-scale and widespread use of chemical and biological weapons, violations have occurred, nonetheless, and the treaties remain problematic in numerous ways. The centennial of this historic 1925 agreement and its successor treaties presents an opportunity for reflection upon their efficacy. Given that there have been ""limited"" episodes of chemical and biological warfare since that time, how can these events be explained in light of the protocol's prohibitions? This essay argues that the 1925 Geneva Protocol has a mixed legacy and, at best, can be deemed only a qualified success. Other factors, such as political deterrence, scientific and technological limitations, and the problematic nature of these types of weapons may account for the absence of their mass use. The essay aims to serve as an introduction to the historiographical literature with an emphasis on biological weapons and the Geneva Protocol and includes tables as reference guides concerning the types of weaponized pathogens and toxins in question.",2025,Frontiers in microbiology,L1_scientific_engagement

A systematic search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in the EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, covering the period from 2006 to 31 August 2025. Screening criteria were developed based on the PICOS principle. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (RoB 2) was used to evaluate the quality of the literature, and meta-analysis was performed using STATA 15.0 software. A total of 12 RCTs involving 1,151 patients were included. The results showed that tele-rehabilitation was effective in VAS Pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI: -1.25-0.10), WOMAC pain (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.98-0.83), WOMAC function (SMD = -0.44, 95% CI: -0.88-0.00), and KOOS total (SMD = 0.52, 95% CI: -0.37-1.40), showing a trend toward improvement, but none reached statistical significance except for WOMAC function score. Sensitivity analyses showed robust results, and Egger's test did not reveal significant publication bias. Tele-rehabilitation shows positive trends in pain and functional improvement in middle-aged and older adult patients with KOA; however, current evidence is insufficient to demonstrate significant superiority. Given its good accessibility, tele-rehabilitation can be used as a complementary modality to traditional rehabilitation. More high-quality studies are needed to clarify its optimal intervention protocol and long-term efficacy.

41480081,"Exploring stress mediation: self-efficacy, sense of coherence, and self-esteem among nursing students in Poland-a multicenter cross-sectional observational study.","Nursing students frequently encounter stressful and demanding situations during clinical training, which may hinder their well-being and professional development. A strong sense of coherence is thought to buffer the negative effects of stress and support adaptive coping. This study aimed to examine levels of sense of coherence, self-esteem, and self-efficacy among undergraduate nursing students in Poland, and to investigate whether perceived stress mediates the relationships between sense of coherence and self-esteem, as well as between sense of coherence and self-efficacy. A cross-sectional observational survey was conducted among 2,689 nursing students enrolled in bachelor-level programs across multiple universities in Poland. Data collection utilized standardized tools, including the Sense of Coherence-29 Scale, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale 10. Statistical analyses involved mediation modeling using Hayes' PROCESS macro, with bootstrapping (5,000 resamples) to assess indirect effects. Participants completed sociodemographic questionnaires along with standardized measures assessing sense of coherence, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and stress. The majority of students (84.0%) reported high stress levels, while two-thirds demonstrated average self-efficacy. Sex was associated with comprehensibility and manageability, and marital status was related to comprehensibility. Stress severity significantly mediated the relationships between specific components of sense of coherence and both self-esteem and self-efficacy. These findings emphasize the detrimental impact of stress on key components of sense of coherence and indicate that targeted educational and psychological interventions aimed at strengthening sense of coherence may help nursing students reduce stress, enhance self-efficacy, and promote overall well-being. The study underscores the multifaceted role of stress in shaping nursing students' psychological resources and coping capacities.",2025,Frontiers in public health,L1_scientific_engagement
41479994,Coronary drug-coated balloons: Current evidence and emerging trends.,"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary and peripheral stenoses has advanced rapidly over the past three decades, driven by a series of innovative techniques since the introduction of the first balloon angioplasty. Significant progress in stent technology, beginning with bare-metal stents and followed by drug-eluting stents, has expanded the scope for successful revascularisation in complex lesions. However, challenges such as late stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis (ISR) persist. Thus, further improvement in PCI techniques and devices is essential to achieve better patient outcomes.

41479943,Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in pediatric gastroenterology: Diagnostic and therapeutic applications.,"Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is considered an essential procedure in pediatric gastroenterology. It has evolved over many decades into a state where it plays a crucial role in providing diagnostic and therapeutic advantages across a broad spectrum of diseases. This review examines its role in diagnosing and managing common pediatric GI conditions, emphasizing notable advancements in techniques, clinical use, and future directions. We conducted a detailed literature survey using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and English-language articles were reviewed. This review process included the latest articles, guidelines, and conference papers on pediatric and adult upper GI endoscopy. An upper GI endoscopy is imperative in diagnosing many pediatric GI diseases as it enables visualization of the gut mucosa, obtaining mucosal biopsies from suspicious areas or lesions for histological assessment, and selecting an effective management and follow-up plan. New advancements, including high-resolution endoscopy, narrow-band imaging, and confocal laser endomicroscopy, have revolutionized pediatric endoscopy by improving precision and reducing the need for invasive interventions. Furthermore, recent therapeutic developments in the field, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection, are now being utilized to treat preneoplastic lesions or refractory esophageal strictures. However, despite its usefulness, performing this procedure in children is challenging for various reasons, including the need for sedation, anesthesia, and smaller instrument sizes, the unavailability of trained staff, lack of training facilities, and the absence of dedicated endoscopy suites for children. In conclusion, pediatric upper GI endoscopy plays a pivotal role in pediatric gastroenterology, offering both therapeutic and diagnostic benefits. Progress in the field leads to the development of novel techniques that improve overall patient care, such as artificial intelligence in pattern recognition, which enhances lesion detection, predicts premalignant or pre-inflammatory areas, and minimizes investigator-related errors.

41479939,Endoscopic ultrasound-guided coil embolization for gastric varices: A promising alternative to traditional therapies.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided vascular interventions have expanded the reach of therapeutic endoscopy to include vascular pathology previously inaccessible by endoscopists. Gastric variceal bleeding comprises 20% of all variceal bleeding and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Historically, endoscopic injection of thrombosis-inducing agents such as glue has been used. However, glue injection carries potential risks including systemic embolization, damage to the endoscope, and recurrent bleeding. The introduction of hemostatic coils has revolutionized the endoscopic approach, with EUS-guided coil embolization emerging as an effective and safe modality for the management of gastric varices (GVs). When compared with conventional glue injection, EUS-guided embolization is associated with improved visualization, higher efficacy, and better safety profile. Despite its expanding adoption, the standardization of EUS guided embolization remains a challenge.

41479916,The long pentraxin 3: the invisible loom weaving the warp and weft of tumor destiny.,"Pentraxins, which constitute a family of evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition molecules, are categorized into short and long branches. The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a key member of the long pentraxin subfamily, while the C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P represent the short pentraxins. All pentraxins share a highly conserved C-terminal motif, an 8-amino acid sequence known as the pentraxin signature. PTX3 can be produced by a wide range of cell types, including immune cells such as dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as various non-immune cells, underscoring its pleiotropic roles in multiple pathophysiological processes. These include inflammation, infection, tissue repair, female fertility, and cancer. Although PTX3 engages commonly recognized signaling pathways, such as TNF-α, NF-κB, FGF, and PI3K/AKT, it can exert paradoxical effects in different cellular contexts, either promoting or inhibiting the proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted roles of PTX3 in various cancers, while also summarizing its functions in other physiological or pathological contexts. Furthermore, we critically examine the challenges and translational opportunities of PTX3, aiming to inform future research directions and therapeutic strategies for cancer management.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

41479893,Microbiota and antibiotic exposure in sarcoidosis.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder characterized by excessive immune activation in genetically predisposed individuals. Despite decades of investigation, its etiology remains unresolved. Emerging evidence indicates that disruptions in host-microbiota homeostasis may contribute to immune dysregulation and disease persistence, challenging the traditional view of sarcoidosis as a purely immune-mediated condition. Recent findings have revealed alterations in both respiratory and intestinal microbiota among patients with sarcoidosis, suggesting that microbial dysbiosis may influence T-cell polarization and granulomatous inflammation. Antibiotic exposure, particularly to macrolides and tetracyclines, represents a largely overlooked modifier that may alter this equilibrium through combined microbiota-dependent and immunomodulatory mechanisms. Given the frequent use of antibiotics in these patients for respiratory infections or off-label anti-inflammatory purposes, understanding their effect on microbial diversity, immune signaling, and disease course warrants systematic evaluation. We propose an integrative framework combining microbiota profiling, immune phenotyping, and therapeutic exposure to delineate microbiota-immunity interactions in sarcoidosis. Multi-omics strategies, supported by advanced computational and network-based analyses, could uncover microbe-immune signatures predictive of chronicity or treatment response. Defining how antibiotics shape these interactions may provide a foundation for microbiota-informed, immune-targeted, and ultimately personalized interventions. Deciphering the interplay between microbiota composition, antibiotic exposure, and immune regulation has the potential to reshape our understanding of sarcoidosis pathogenesis and to guide the development of precision-based therapeutic strategies.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,L1_scientific_engagement
41479839,Donor-derived cell-free DNA and its utility in kidney transplantation: A myth or a reality.,"Renal allograft rejection and its detection are challenging problems for transplant clinicians. Transplant physicians rely on serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, donor-specific antibodies, and graft biopsy to detect rejection. The sensitivity and specificity in these blood and urine tests are low, and the invasiveness of graft biopsy has led transplant clinicians to seek alternative diagnostic tools. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a fragment of DNA released from cell death due to necrosis and apoptosis. Donor-derived cfDNA (dd-cfDNA) has been proposed as a potential non-invasive biomarker for detecting rejection. However, one must interpret it cautiously in conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, delayed graft function, BK virus nephropathy, post-kidney biopsy, and dual kidney transplantation, which may cause dd-cfDNA elevation. There is a lack of standardized cutoff values for diagnosing various types of rejections. Low specificity, higher cost, and lack of universal availability are the multiple obstacles to using this tool. There is a need to establish clinical guidelines for its future utility in early rejection detection, graft surveillance, and tailoring of immunosuppression.",2025,World journal of nephrology,L1_scientific_engagement

To evaluate the efficacy of multifocal tES in enhancing cognitive function by examining targeted brain regions, stimulation protocols, and behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted up to February 10, 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The inclusion criteria encompassed human studies utilizing concurrent dual-site or multifocal tES with pre- and post-intervention behavioral assessments. Studies on deep brain stimulation, corticocortical paired associative stimulation, sequential stimulation, case reports, and reviews were excluded. Of the 1,453 initial records, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The studies predominantly employed transcranial direct current stimulation/transcranial alternating current stimulation, targeting the frontoparietal network. Neurophysiological data from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed network-level modulations. Behavioral outcomes were inconsistent, with some studies reporting improvements in executive function, working memory, and response inhibition, whereas others showed no significant advantages over sham stimulation. Although multifocal tES is a promising modality, clearly determining its efficacy is currently limited by heterogeneous study designs, small sample sizes, and conflicting findings.

41479777,Overcoming the sorafenib resistance mechanism in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia: molecular basis and new targets.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates from myeloid hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 30% of patients exhibit FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations clinically, which is associated with a poor prognosis. FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FLT3-TKIs), including sorafenib, demonstrate efficacy in FLT3-mutated AML, but resistance remains a significant challenge. However, various mechanisms have led to the rapid development of resistance to sorafenib treatment, including both primary and secondary drug resistance. Primary resistance refers to sorafenib's initial treatment failure due to redundant signaling pathways and tumor heterogeneity, while secondary resistance develops after prolonged therapy through new genetic mutations or activation of alternative pathways. This study systematically examines mechanisms of sorafenib resistance in AML, including tumor genetic changes and the bone marrow microenvironment. It outlines classic mechanisms, such as FLT3 functions, kinase mutations, and cellular signaling pathways, while also addressing gaps in knowledge regarding resistance driven by metabolic factors and the bone marrow environment. Furthermore, the paper explores novel FLT3 inhibitors and combination therapies, while outlining future directions for precision intervention through dynamic monitoring of clonal evolution.

41479639,"Artificial intelligence in hepatopathy diagnosis and treatment: Big data analytics, deep learning, and clinical prediction models.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of hepatology by enabling automated data interpretation, early disease detection, and individualized treatment strategies. Chronic liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, often progress silently and pose diagnostic challenges due to reliance on invasive biopsies and operator-dependent imaging. This review explores the integration of AI across key domains such as big data analytics, deep learning-based image analysis, histopathological interpretation, biomarker discovery, and clinical prediction modeling. AI algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy in liver fibrosis staging, hepatocellular carcinoma detection, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease risk stratification, while also enhancing survival prediction and treatment response assessment. For instance, convolutional neural networks trained on portal venous-phase computed tomography have achieved area under the curves up to 0.92 for significant fibrosis (F2-F4) and 0.89 for advanced fibrosis, with magnetic resonance imaging-based models reporting comparable performance. Advanced methodologies such as federated learning preserve patient privacy during cross-center model training, and explainable AI techniques promote transparency and clinician trust. Despite these advancements, clinical adoption remains limited by challenges including data heterogeneity, algorithmic bias, regulatory uncertainty, and lack of real-time integration into electronic health records. Looking forward, the convergence of multi-omics, imaging, and clinical data through interpretable and validated AI frameworks holds great promise for precision liver care. Continued efforts in model standardization, ethical oversight, and clinician-centered deployment will be essential to realize the full potential of AI in hepatopathy diagnosis and treatment.",2025,World journal of gastroenterology,L1_scientific_engagement
41479596,Xenin-Derived Peptides: Multifaceted Regulators and Therapeutic Innovations in Metabolic Diseases.,"Xenin, a 25-amino acid peptide hormone predominantly secreted by intestinal K cells, demonstrates evolutionary conservation with neuropeptides such as xenopsin and neurotensin. Functionally, it engages neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) to regulate appetite via hypothalamic signaling pathways and modulates glucose homeostasis through synergistic interactions with incretin hormones. Preclinical studies highlight its dual role in suppressing appetite and enhancing pancreatic β-cell survival, while a single pilot human study suggests xenin-25 may delay gastric emptying and attenuate postprandial glucose excursions; however, these data await independent confirmation. Native xenin, however, is constrained by rapid proteolytic degradation and limited bioavailability. Advances in peptide engineering, including C-terminal truncation, site-directed amino acid substitution, and lipidation, have generated analogues that exhibit prolonged metabolic activity in rodent models, with plasma half-life extended from minutes to hours. In murine models of metabolic dysfunction, these derivatives enhance insulin secretion, improve glycaemic profiles and restore incretin responsiveness. Furthermore, multi-agonist peptides combining xenin with other gastrointestinal hormones show synergistic potential in preclinical studies, concurrently augmenting insulin secretion and reducing energy intake, though their clinical relevance remains to be validated in human trials. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, challenges persist in translating xenin-based therapies to clinical practice, including incomplete mechanistic insights into receptor cross-talk and species-specific variations in gastrointestinal responses. This review uniquely integrates the preclinical landscape of xenin biology, peptide-engineering principles, and emerging multi-agonist design, identifying knowledge gaps critical for future translation. We conclude that xenin-based therapeutics are a promising yet early-stage strategy whose efficacy and safety in human metabolic diseases remain to be established through rigorous pharmacokinetic profiling and phased clinical trials.",2025,"Drug design, development and therapy",L1_scientific_engagement
41479594,Discovery of Pyrazoline Benzenesulfonamide Derivatives as Anticancer Agents: A Review.,"Pyrazoline benzenesulfonamide derivatives represent a distinctive class of heterocyclic compounds that synergistically combine the pharmacological versatility of the pyrazoline scaffold with the enzyme-inhibitory prowess of benzenesulfonamide moieties. These hybrids have emerged as promising candidates in anticancer drug discovery. This review systematically examines various synthetic strategies employed to prepare these derivatives, including classical Claisen-Schmidt condensation as well as modern ultrasound- and microwave-assisted protocols. These methods facilitate efficient structural diversification, incorporating a wide range of heterocyclic and aromatic substituents such as morpholine, pyrazole, benzodioxole, tetrazole, and ferrocene. Biological evaluations, integrating both in vitro cytotoxicity assays and in silico molecular docking studies, were analyzed to elucidate the anticancer potential and mechanistic insights of these compounds, particularly their selective inhibition of tumor-associated enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9), carbonic anhydrase isoforms (hCA IX, hCA XII), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The results reveal that several derivatives exhibit potent antiproliferative activity across multiple cancer cell lines, including lung (A549), breast (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa), colon (COLO 205), and oral squamous carcinoma, demonstrating significant tumor selectivity and low toxicity toward normal cells. Structure-activity relationship analyses further underscore the critical influence of electronic substituents and their positioning on aromatic rings in modulating both efficacy and selectivity. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of pyrazoline benzenesulfonamide derivatives and support the continued optimization of synthetic strategies and mechanistic studies to facilitate their development as effective anticancer agents capable of overcoming clinical challenges such as drug resistance and adverse side effects.",2025,"Drug design, development and therapy",L1_scientific_engagement

41479510,Clinical study on the efficacy of laparoscopic hepatectomy ,"Laparoscopic hepatectomy has been widely accepted for the treatment of liver tumors. Compared with open surgery, it provides a reduced hospital stay, less intraoperative blood loss, less trauma, and fewer incisional infections, without affecting tumor outcomes. However, lesions in the right lobe of the liver are deep and obstructed by the ribs, making exposure difficult and increasing the degree of surgical difficulty; thus, liver tumors in the deep right lobe pose technical challenges in standard laparoscopic surgery. To investigate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic retroperitoneal partial hepatectomy for liver tumors. The clinical data of 72 patients who underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal partial hepatectomy for liver tumors between January 2018 and December 2024 at the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province were analyzed. Of the 72 patients included, 34 were male and 38 were female, with ages ranging from 34 years to 72 years (median age, 45 years). The tumors were all located in the right lobe of the liver, with 30 cases in segment S6, 27 cases in segment S7, and 15 cases in segment S8; the mean tumor diameter was 7.5 ± 3.4 cm. The postoperative tumor indices, liver function, and postoperative complications were analyzed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of laparoscopic partial hepatectomy The surgeries were successfully completed in all patients, and conversion to open surgery was required in 10 patients. The mean operative time, blood loss, drain retention time, and length of postoperative hospital stay were 140 ± 30 minutes, 150 ± 46 mL, 3.8 ± 1.2 days, and 8.3 ± 5.3 days, respectively. Liver function tests returned to normal in all patients within two weeks of surgery. Fifteen patients developed atelectasis and pleural effusion and were managed with incision and drainage and antibiotics. Two patients developed uncomplicated minimal ascites, and the remaining patients had no perioperative complications, such as abdominal hemorrhage, infection, liver failure, bile leakage, and other adverse events. All patients were successfully treated. Laparoscopic retroperitoneal partial hepatectomy is a safe and effective approach for right hepatic space-occupying lesions, particularly in segments S6, S7, and S8, with fewer postoperative complications, less trauma, and faster recovery times. This procedure provides a new surgical access for resection of deep tumors in the right lobe of the liver and has clear clinical implications.",2025,World journal of hepatology,L1_scientific_engagement

41478666,Emerging pharmacology of targeted protein degraders.,"Targeted protein degradation is an emerging strategy for experimental and therapeutic ablation of biologically important proteins. To elicit the degradation of their cellular targets, targeted protein degraders act by co-opting the endogenous cellular degradation machineries through chemically-induced proximity. While targeted protein degradation was serendipitously discovered as the mode of action of approved anticancer drugs including fulvestrant and thalidomide, recent years have witnessed systematic endeavors for the rational design of targeted protein degraders for diverse biological targets. Such endeavors have led to 3 major classes of targeted protein degraders including molecular glue degraders, proteolysis targeting chimeras, and hydrophobic tag-based degraders. Of these, several agents are clinically approved or currently evaluated in clinical trials for use in diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and dermatologic conditions. The novel chemical and pharmacologic nature of targeted protein degraders heralds an emerging paradigm of pharmacology, known as event-driven pharmacology, which is different in many aspects from the occupancy-based pharmacology of conventional small-molecule inhibitors. In this review, we discuss the emerging pharmacology of different classes of targeted protein degraders including the molecular basis of their drug action and key pharmacologic properties pertinent to efficacy, selectivity, safety, and dosing considerations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Targeted protein degradation is a novel strategy that establishes induced-proximity pharmacology as a promising next-generation therapeutic modality.

The objective of this investigation was to ascertain the efficacy of vitamin D treatment in managing MAFLD. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, extending until April 2025. After analyzing and screening 2123 studies, 21 studies meeting the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis were selected. A random effects model was utilized to determine the mean change in the standard mean difference (SMD) for various variables, including insulin, fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLc), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Heterogeneity was assessed using I Pooled analysis demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced: FBG levels (-0.21; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.02), insulin (-0.60, 95%CI: -1.15, -0.05), HOMA-IR (-0.70; 95%CI: -1.23, -0.17), TG (-0.32; 95%CI: -0.60, -0.05) and ALT (-0.50; 95%CI: -0.90, -0.11), while increasing HDLc (0.30; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.59). However, vitamin D supplementation did not show a significant effect on TC (-0.28; 95%CI: -0.61, 0.05), AST (-0.29; 95%CI: -0.60, 0.02), or LDLc (-0.17; 95%CI: -0.41, 0.07). The findings of this study indicate that vitamin D supplementation exerts a positive impact on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, specifically in terms of fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, HDLc, and ALT levels among patients with MAFLD. Therefore, vitamin D could serve as an adjunctive therapy for fatty liver management in this patient population.",2025,The Journal of nutrition,L1_scientific_engagement
41478541,Precision therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease: Amyloid β-targeted foundations and multimodal next-generation approaches.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and a significant unmet medical challenge, pathologically characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, and chronic neuroinflammation. Although Aβ has long been a central therapeutic target, clinical translation has historically been hindered by late-stage intervention, inadequate blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, and the molecular heterogeneity of AD. Recent advances with Aβ-targeted monoclonal antibodies, particularly lecanemab and donanemab, have provided the first clinical evidence of disease modification, demonstrating robust amyloid clearance and measurable slowing of cognitive decline in early-stage AD. These results validate the Aβ hypothesis but also highlight persistent barriers, including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), questions about the durability of benefit, challenges in patient stratification, and the high economic burden of biologics. To overcome these limitations, next-generation strategies are emerging that extend beyond single-pathway targeting toward multimodal and precision-based frameworks. Innovative approaches include tau-directed therapies to prevent the propagation of neurofibrillary tangles, immunomodulatory strategies to enhance microglial clearance of aggregated proteins, and neuroprotective interventions to counteract oxidative and inflammatory stress. Concurrently, nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems are being engineered to efficiently traverse the BBB and deliver multifunctional payloads, while artificial intelligence (AI)- driven discovery platforms are accelerating target identification, biomarker integration, and patient stratification. Future perspectives emphasize the importance of preclinical-stage intervention, long-term efficacy trials, and the adoption of personalised treatment paradigms that integrate genomic, biomarker, and digital profiling to optimise outcomes. Collectively, these advances signal a paradigm shift in AD therapeutics, positioning Aβ-targeted therapies as a foundation while paving the way for combination strategies that more effectively address the disease's multifactorial nature.",2025,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,L1_scientific_engagement

However, this largely centered on indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). The clinical failure of IDO1 inhibitors has exposed the limitations of this reductionist view. To re-synthesize current knowledge into a further understanding of Trp metabolism, and propose biomarker-guided, multi-node intervention strategies that can resurrect Trp metabolism as a precision immuno-oncology target. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: This review comprehensively describes the pathways of Trp metabolism in the human body and the key enzymes that can serve as therapeutic targets, thus proposing the possibility of multi enzyme combined inhibition. Second, we synthesize how Trp metabolites can modulate the functionality of immune cells, mainly T cells, within the tumor microenvironment, thereby affecting tumor immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapy. Then we discuss how tumor cells manipulate Trp metabolic pathways to enhance their survival and metastasis. We also propose a new framework for targeting Trp metabolism, such as combining enzymes inhibitors or Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonists with immune checkpoint blockade. By shifting from ""IDO1-focus"" paradigms to comprehensive metabolic interventions, we may release more potential of Trp modulation in cancer immunotherapy.",2025,Journal of advanced research,L1_scientific_engagement

Particularly, we explore the pivotal role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in FMT for treating neurological disorders, as well as how FMT influences neurological function by regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolites, immune system and inflammatory responses, and neurotransmitters. However, FMT also faces numerous challenges in the treatment of neurological disorders, such as ethical issues, safety concerns, and standardization problems. Therefore, this review also prospects the future development directions of FMT in the treatment of neurological diseases, including personalized therapy and combination therapies. FMT may be a feasible and promising option for treating various neurological disorders, but a comprehensive understanding of its working principles and continuous improvement of its application in clinical practice are still ongoing.",2025,Experimental neurology,L1_scientific_engagement
41478378,Nanomedicine-mediated modulation of tumor metabolism for enhanced immunotherapy.,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment. However, its efficacy remains limited in many cases. A key factor contributing to this limitation is metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment (TME), which suppresses immune cell function and promotes tumor progression. Recently, nanotechnology-based approaches have opened new ways to modulate tumor metabolism and enhance immunotherapy. This review outlines nanoscale strategies aimed at reprogramming tumor metabolism to potentiate antitumor immunity. We begin by discussing the rational design of immune-metabolic nanoregulators, along with key immunometabolic pathways and their regulatory mechanisms. Next, nanotechnology strategies for targeted metabolic intervention at the cellular and microbial levels, as well as the metabolic characteristics of TME are systematically summarized. Furthermore, we highlight recent advances in nanomedicine-based metabolic regulators and evaluate their potential for clinical translation, addressing both opportunities and challenges.",2025,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,L1_scientific_engagement
41478371,Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Facial Nerve Schwannoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Facial nerve schwannomas (FNS) are rare intracranial lesions that pose a therapeutic challenge due to their proximity to critical neurovascular anatomical structures. While microsurgical resection (MS) is linked to a significant risk of facial nerve dysfunction, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a non-invasive alternative that may reduce the potential damage to the facial nerve. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of SRS in patients with FNS. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science, following the PRISMA guideline. Studies that evaluate local control (LC), facial nerve function (FNF), hearing function (HF), and adverse radiation effect (ARE) for SRS in FNS were included. Ten studies comparing 166 FNS cases were included. The meta-analysis showed a pooled LC rate of 99% (95% CI: 95-100%). It revealed a pooled improved or stable FNF rate of 76% (95% CI: 56-92%) and HF rate of 92% (95% CI: 77-100%). Additionally, the analysis exhibited a pooled ARE rate of 9% (95% CI: 5-16%) following SRS in FNS patients. SRS is an effective and safe option for managing FNS patients, showing promising clinical and radiological outcomes, especially in those with small-sized lesions or favorable FNF. Future studies should focus on directly comparing SRS and MS in large, prospective, multicenter trials.",2025,World neurosurgery,L1_scientific_engagement
41478276,Cancer cell death: Cell-autonomous and immunogenic dimensions.,"Regulated cell death (RCD) shapes neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, and response to treatment. While apoptosis was long viewed as the only RCD variant, additional modalities, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, have been characterized. These interconnected pathways operate in a context-dependent manner to influence the dynamic interplay between malignant and non-malignant cells that governs disease progression or regression, both naturally and during therapy. Major advances stemmed from recognizing immunogenic cell death (ICD) as an RCD type defined by the emission of immunomodulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying cancer cells. The balance between immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive DAMPs dictates whether neoplastic cells undergoing RCD effectively activate adaptive immunity. Thus, ICD provides mechanistic grounds for the durable efficacy of certain cancer therapeutics, and underpins their synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Understanding the molecular determinants of RCD and ICD is reshaping oncology, allowing for an increasingly refined integration between cytotoxicity and durable anticancer immune responses.",2025,Cancer cell,L1_scientific_engagement
41478176,Efficacy and safety of continuous theta burst stimulation for auditory hallucinations: A GRADE-assessed meta-analysis of randomized sham-controlled trials.,"Auditory hallucinations (AHs) represent a clinical burden and are refractory to antipsychotics in approximately 25 % of cases. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) has been explored as a neuromodulation option in treating AHs. However, the current evidence regarding its efficacy is inconclusive. This is the first meta-analysis to synthesize evidence exclusively from sham-controlled trials. We conducted comprehensive search until September 2025 to include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared cTBS versus sham stimulation in patients experiencing AHs. The primary outcome was the change in AHs measured by validated scales, pooled using standardized mean difference (SMD). Five RCTs, including 326 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, were included. cTBS demonstrated a statistically significant superiority over sham stimulation in reducing AHs (SMD = -0.34, 95 % CI [-0.57, -0.12], P = 0.002), with no heterogeneity (P = 0.92, I The findings of our study suggest that cTBS can be safely applied and may be effective in reducing auditory hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, particularly in patients with limited response to antipsychotic medication. Further RCTs are needed to confirm our results and identify the optimal treatment parameters.",2025,Asian journal of psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement

41478151,Clinical outcomes of microvascular clipping compared to endovascular coiling for ruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms.,"A ruptured intracranial aneurysm is a devastating pathology that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The anterior communicating artery (ACOM) is the most common location to have an intracranial aneurysm form and rupture. The two management options for ruptured intracranial aneurysms include microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling. The clinical outcomes of microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling for ruptured ACOM aneurysms remains unclear. The aim of this review was to investigate the clinical outcomes, including functional outcomes, treatment efficacy and safety of microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling for the management of ruptured ACOM aneurysms. A search for published and unpublished literature included PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Clinical Trial Registry, Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry Search Strategy and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies were included if they explored the functional outcomes and/or safety of microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling for ruptured ACOM aneurysms. Eligible studies were critically appraised by two reviewers to assess methodological qualitied. Where possible, data from included studies was meta-analysed using a random effects Mantel-Haenszel model. Effect measures included odds ratio and risk difference where no events were recorded. The search yielded 818 records. Following screening of titles and abstracts against the review inclusion criteria, 25 articles were retrieved for full-text screening. Of these, 11 studies, all of which were non-randomised studies (2 quasi-experimental and 9 retrospective cohort studies), were included. For the primary outcome (favourable functional outcomes), analysis revealed overall no statistically significant difference between microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling (79.4 % versus 73.6 %, OR 1.11, 95 % CI 0.78 - 1.57, p = 0.56). Results from the quasi-experimental studies demonstrated favourable outcomes in the clipping group were non-significantly higher than the coiling group (86.2 % versus 80.4 %, OR 2.26, 95 % CI 0.6-8.52, p = 0.23). In cohort studies, favourable outcomes in the clipping group were non-significantly higher than the coiling group (78.9 % versus 72.3 %, OR 1.05, 95 % CI 0.71-1.53, p = 0.23). For the secondary outcomes of recurrence and complications, overall no statistically significant difference was found between clipping versus coiling (recurrence - 4.6 % versus 5.7 %, RD 0.00, 95 % CI -0.06 - 0.06, p = 0.47; complications- 21.6 % versus 14.2 %, OR 1.00 95 % CI 0.49 - 2.05, p = 1.00). Occlusion was found to be significantly higher in the clipping group compared to coiling (95 % versus 75 %, OR 7.01, 95 % CI 2.82 - 17.45, p=<0.0001). Microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling appear to be equally effective and safe for the treatment of ruptured ACOM aneurysms.

41478129,Endometrial immune profile: A predictor of pregnancy success.,"The likelihood of a successful pregnancy is influenced by a set of variables that influence endometrial receptivity, including hormonal, genetic, metabolic, age, lifestyle, and immunological factors. Among these, the endometrial immune profile has received particular attention as a critical actor of implantation and embryo tolerance. Dynamic fluctuations in immune cell populations-such as macrophages, dendritic cells, uterine natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells-across the menstrual cycle might significantly affect the endometrium's capacity to support successful implantation. Recent evidence highlights that disruptions in the quantity, phenotype, or function of these immune cells contribute to impaired endometrial receptivity in infertility-related disorders, including recurrent implantation failure, recurrent pregnancy loss, endometriosis, and polycystic ovary syndrome. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of immune cell composition and function in the healthy endometrium compared to pathological conditions, emphasizing how immune dysregulation may impair pregnancy. Furthermore, we evaluate both current and emerging diagnostic modalities-from immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics-and endometrial microbiome impact on immune profiling that enables more precise characterization of immune profile dysregulation, alongside established and investigational therapies, with particular attention to their efficacy and mechanistic rationale. By integrating these insights, a clinically oriented framework can be provided to guide the development of personalized diagnostic algorithms and targeted immune-based therapies that, ultimately, could lead to improved implantation rates and live birth outcomes in individuals facing infertility disorders with immunological causes.",2025,Reproductive biology,L1_scientific_engagement

41477713,[Modern Approaches to Anti-EGFR Therapy].,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is among the research subjects of most interest and remains genuinely attractive due to its key role in regulating the main conserved signaling pathways responsible for cell growth, survival, and proliferation. Dysregulation of the signaling pathways leads to cell malignant transformation, tumor progression, and metastasis. Therefore, EGFR is considered as one of the main targets for anticancer drug development. Although several generations of novel anti-EGFR drugs have been successfully developed, acquisition of drug resistance and the mutation status of the downstream effector protein KRAS significantly reduce the tumor response to therapy. The review focuses on the current approaches to anti-EGFR therapy. Drugs designed to block the EGFR-mediated signaling are described, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and immunotoxins. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy are discussed, and combination treatment strategies are proposed to improve the efficacy of the available drugs.

41477586,A lack of evidence for disability-inclusive maternal health interventions and promising progress: an updated systematic review.,"Pregnant women with disabilities experience significantly higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to those without disabilities. Evidence-based interventions that address disability-related barriers during pregnancy are essential to reducing health disparities. We aimed to update a 2014 systematic review to identify interventions designed for pregnant women with disabilities. We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2012 and 2025 to identify interventions addressing disability-related barriers during pregnancy and birth. We found a striking absence of evidence with no eligible studies identified from 22,719 publications. While we found multiple studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of medications to manage disability-associated conditions during pregnancy, none of these studies focused on the potential disabling impact of the health conditions for pregnant women with disabilities, our intended focus. However, in our discussion, we describe three recent pilots, including co-produced resources for pregnant patients with disabilities, educational interventions for midwives, and an innovative patient empowerment tool, that suggest the field may be at a turning point. Our systematic review did not find evidence of disability inclusive maternal health interventions to improve pregnancy and childbirth experiences. However, we point to limited but promising studies for their use of co-production and patient engagement principles underscoring the potential for accelerating progress when research is conducted with, rather than on, disabled communities. While the pilots serve as proof of concept that disability-inclusive reproductive health research is both necessary and achievable, investments in disability inclusive maternal healthcare could yield significant returns for those with disabilities.",2025,Frontiers in global women's health,L1_scientific_engagement

41477466,Biomarkers Detecting the Activity of ANCA-Associated Vasculitis: A Systematic Literature Review.,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) encompasses a group of rare systemic autoimmune diseases characterized by inflammation of small- and medium-sized blood vessels. Despite the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in achieving disease remission, a significant proportion of patients experience relapses, underscoring the need for reliable biomarkers to monitor disease activity. This systematic literature review evaluates the potential of urinary and serum biomarkers (CD163, CD206, CD25, and MCP-1) to detect active AAV in adult patients. A comprehensive search on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases identified relevant studies, which were screened and assessed for inclusion based on predefined criteria. Data extraction and quality appraisal were independently conducted using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2). A total of 20 studies evaluated biomarkers for their diagnostic accuracy in detecting AAV activity. Most articles were scored as moderate risk of bias, with low concerns regarding applicability. Urinary soluble CD163 shows promising diagnostic accuracy for active renal vasculitis, with sensitivity and specificity values ranging from 0.72 to 1 and 0.67 to 0.98, respectively. Serum soluble CD163 and CD206 demonstrated variable accuracy. Serum MCP-1 did not differ between patients in remission and patients with active disease, while urinary MCP-1 showed potential but with inconsistent results across studies. Serum soluble CD25 was significantly elevated in active disease. Some combinations of biomarkers improved diagnostic performance (usCD163 + usCD25 + ssCD25 and usCD163 + serum Calprotectin + hematuria). In conclusion, while usCD163 individually appears to be the most reliable single biomarker for detecting active renal vasculitis in these studies, the heterogeneity of study designs and cutoff values across studies precludes definitive conclusions. Further research is necessary to standardize biomarker use, evaluate promising biomarker combinations, and improve the accuracy of activity monitoring both in renal and extrarenal AAV.",2025,International journal of nephrology,L1_scientific_engagement

41477452,"Adult ADHD as a risk factor for dementia: integrating longitudinal evidence, mechanistic insights, and the role of stimulant treatment.","Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized as a persistent neurodevelopmental condition with long-term implications for cognitive aging and dementia risk. Epidemiological and longitudinal studies indicate that adults with ADHD have a higher incidence of non-amnestic dementia subtypes, including Lewy body disease, and may be particularly susceptible to age-related cognitive decline. Convergent mechanistic evidence implicates dopaminergic dysregulation, possible Wnt/mTOR pathway alterations, oxidative stress, and chronic neuroinflammation as shared biological pathways linking ADHD to neurodegeneration. Psychiatric comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and reduced cognitive reserve may further amplify vulnerability, decreasing the brain's resilience to neuropathological insults. Preliminary data suggest that stimulant treatments, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine derivatives, may attenuate dementia risk by normalizing dopaminergic tone, enhancing cortical plasticity, and reducing oxidative stress, although randomized trials are needed to confirm these protective effects. Emerging biomarker and genetic studies, including polygenic ADHD risk scores, α-synuclein, amyloid/tau, and GBA mutations, offer opportunities for early detection, risk stratification, and mechanistic insights. Integrating epidemiological, neuroimaging, molecular, and pharmacological data could guide targeted preventive interventions, highlighting ADHD as a developmental and potentially modifiable risk factor for late-life neurodegenerative disorders.",2025,Frontiers in dementia,L1_scientific_engagement

Subsequently, its mechanism reveals additional cardiovascular and renal benefits, necessitating further investigation into its effects on heart failure. This condition affects millions and leads to diminished quality of life, frequent hospitalizations, and high mortality rates. This review aims to evaluate several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the favourable outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure and its related variables, including hospitalizations secondary to the condition, mortality rate, kidney function, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Nine RCTs were reviewed systematically and meta-analyzed to assess the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors. A pooled risk ratio was calculated under a random-effects model, along with heterogeneity analysis, to summarize the overall effect across studies. The studies analyzed two primary clinical outcomes of mortality and rehospitalization due to heart failure. SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with a 20% relative reduction in mortality (risk ratio (RR) = 0.80) and a 24% relative risk reduction of rehospitalization due to heart failure (RR = 0.76). These findings support the cardioprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, as well as significant reductions in hospitalization and mortality. The efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors was observed across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups, supporting their role as a valuable therapeutic option for managing heart failure.",2025,Cureus,L1_scientific_engagement

While bone autografts and allografts offer potential solutions, limitations, including donor scarcity, immune rejection, anatomical constraints, and complications arising from host comorbidities such as diabetes, often lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. This necessitates the need for alternative treatments. Researchers have identified that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in bone regeneration. Although physiological ROS levels are essential for normal healing, excessive ROS accumulation disrupts the balance between bone formation and resorption, hindering regeneration. Antioxidants can mitigate oxidative stress by scavenging ROS or inhibiting their formation, thereby restoring the equilibrium between bone formation and resorption. Advances in nanotechnology have enabled the development of various ROS-scavenging nanomaterials with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. These nanomaterials either function as delivery platforms for conventional antioxidants or as direct ROS-neutralizing agents through intrinsic redox or enzyme-mimicking properties.

41477324,Ferroptosis meets cancer immunotherapy: Overcoming the crosstalk challenges through advanced drug delivery strategies.,"The integration of ferroptosis induction with cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach in oncology, offering dual mechanisms to overcome therapeutic resistance and tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, the dynamic and complicated crosstalk between ferroptosis processes and immune regulation in tumor microenvironments presents both opportunities and challenges. By inducing lipid peroxidation in tumor tissues, ferroptotic tumor cell death can stimulate immunogenicity. Nevertheless, excessive lipid peroxidation may paradoxically impair the functionality of multiple immune cells, thereby presenting crosstalk challenges in therapeutic strategies. To address these crosstalk challenges, several advanced drug delivery strategies have been proposed, such as immunostimulatory active pharmaceutical ingredients co-delivery, tumor-targeted delivery, and stimuli-responsive delivery. These drug delivery strategies demonstrate dual therapeutic efficacy by synergistically potentiating ferroptosis induction in malignant cells while concurrently mitigating immunotoxicity and even augmenting antitumor immunity. This review offers detailed insights into the crosstalk between ferroptosis and tumor immunity, along with a guiding overview of the three delivery strategies.

Diets abundant in plant-based foods, fiber, and prebiotics promote beneficial gut microbiota profiles that support anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic processes. In contrast, the Western dietary pattern, characterized by high levels of saturated fats and processed foods, may lead to dysbiosis, fostering pro-inflammatory conditions and the production of metabolites that enhance tumorigenesis. The gut microbiota influences the behavior of PCa through immune modulation, metabolic by-products, and interactions with systemic therapies. Emerging evidence, primarily derived from preclinical models or studies in non-PCa contexts, suggests that diet and gut microbiota may influence the development and progression of PCa. However, further PCa-specific clinical research is needed to validate these associations. Future research should prioritize the development of precise dietary recommendations and microbiota-targeted therapies that can be seamlessly incorporated into clinical practice for more personalized and effective cancer care.",2025,Frontiers in nutrition,L1_scientific_engagement

A scoping review of scientific evidence was conducted. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases were searched using primary constructs (SCI/D, CMD) from inception to July 1, 2024. Articles must meet the following criteria: (1) full-length article, (2) available in English, (3) SCI/D population aged ≥18 years, and (4) diagnosed CMD and/or evaluated CMD strategies/interventions. The following information was extracted from the included articles: title, country in which the study was conducted, participant characteristics, sociodemographic variables reported, objective/purpose statement, study design, study type, intervention type, CMD risk factors evaluated, assessment time point(s), additional non-CMD outcome measures, use of clinical practice guidelines for risk stratification, summary of results, and report of clinical implications. Of the 1726 studies screened, 120 met the inclusion criteria. Definitions from the Users' Guide to the Medical Literature were used to categorize studies under Diagnosis (n=75; 62.5%), Therapy (n=27; 22.5%), Prognosis (n=14; 11.7%), and Harm (n=4; 3.3%). Diagnosis studies commonly assessed the presence/absence of CMD using screening tools or biomarkers, although only 25 (20.7%) reported on sociodemographic variables, of which race (24.0%), ethnicity (17.3%), and education (13.3%) were most frequently reported. Positive findings for reducing the risk of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus were found across Therapy studies. Most (85.2%) incorporated health-promoting behaviors such as physical activity, nutritional counseling, and behavior change interventions. Four studies (14.8%) evaluated different pharmacologic treatments (atorvastatin, fenofibrate, α-lipoic acid, semaglutide) to target CMD risk factors. Most of the literature on CMD in persons with SCI/D pertains to Diagnosis, reinforcing the increased prevalence and risk compared with the general population. Physical activity was the most studied therapeutic intervention to manage CMD after SCI/D; however, the limited number of therapy studies demonstrates a need to explore the efficacy of tailored interventions and multipronged approaches. Sociodemographic reporting was poor across all study types, highlighting a gap in understanding subgroup risk. Future research should prioritize addressing these gaps to improve CMD care.",2025,Archives of rehabilitation research and clinical translation,L1_scientific_engagement
41476999,GABA: The Peacekeeper Neurotransmitter-Gut-microbiota Derived Origins and Salivary Biomarker Detection Using Elisa.,"The human body is a highly integrated biological system in which the gut flora wields regulatory control beyond simple digestion. Intestinal bacteria control neuronal and behavioral processes via the gut-brain axis; microbial gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis seems to be an essential controller of sleep and central nervous system activity. Increasing data show that neuroactive substances produced from bacteria influence mental health results, circadian rhythm, and sleep structure. This review investigates the function of gut-derived GABA in sleep control, the part that particular bacterial taxa play, and the translational value of salivary GABA as a non-invasive indicator. Literature discussing microbial pathways for GABA production, gut-brain signalling mechanisms, food modulation, and ELISA-based salivary GABA determination was reviewed. Important GABA-producing genera including Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were investigated. Available data indicates that gut bacteria may contribute up to thirty percent of systemic GABA; metabolites of gut microbes like butyrate improve GABAergic signalling via epigenetic and receptor-mediated pathways. Diets high in probiotics and fermentable fibre are continuously linked to better sleep quality, less sleep latency, and greater sleep continuity. Using ELISA, salivary GABA levels between 0.1 and 1 µmol/L can be measured and show circadian fluctuation, thereby favoring saliva as a useful substitute for total neurochemical activity. Salivary GABA is a promising, drug-free biomarker connecting CNS performance, sleep regulation, and gut microbial activity. Its non-invasive character permits extensive clinical and community-based study, therefore supporting longitudinal monitoring of gut-brain interactions. Integration of psychobiotic treatments, AI-guided diet, and point-of-care biosensors may eventually change the stomach to be an organ.",2025,Annals of neurosciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41476987,Above and beyond senescence and CAR T cell: advances and future perspectives.,"Cellular senescence is a complex biological process that contributes to the progression of age-related diseases. Senescent cells accumulate over time and secrete proinflammatory factors that disrupt tissue homeostasis and promote chronic diseases. Initially created for cancer immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has recently been repurposed at the preclinical level to eliminate senescent cells by recognizing senescence-associated surface markers. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated the feasibility of anti-uPAR and anti-NKG2D CAR T cell-based approaches for eliminating senescent cells in preclinical models of fibrosis, metabolic disorders, and natural aging, resulting in reduced fibrotic burden, improved metabolic parameters, and enhanced tissue function. However, several challenges remain in their clinical applicability, including the identification of specific and universal senescence markers, potential off-target effects, and long-term safety concerns. Additionally, immunosenescence, an age-related decline in immune function, poses challenges for CAR T cell therapy in elderly patients. This review discusses recent advancements in CAR T cell therapy for senescence clearance, highlighting key molecular targets, preclinical findings, and future research directions. Despite their promise, a significant translational gap persists, and further research is required to improve the specificity, efficacy, and readiness for future human clinical trials.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

Extracorporeal Photopheresis (ECP) represents a key second-line option. Previous reviews have provided valuable insights, and recent studies allow for an updated synthesis of efficacy, safety, and patterns of ECP use in SR-aGVHD, including outcomes not fully analysed previously. This study aims to address the literature gap by providing a comprehensive updated review of the efficacy of ECP and its patterns of use in SR-aGVHD. A Systematic literature search was conducted as per PRISMA guidelines, up to September 2024, using the PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Studies investigating the use of ECP in the setting of chronic GVHD, GVHD prophylaxis, or first-line treatment of aGVHD were excluded. Meta-analyses using fixed and random effects models were employed to estimate the pooled effect sizes. Thirty-eight studies, including a total of 1249 participants, were included, and 29 were included in the quantitative analyses. Most studies focused on the adult population, and the majority used a retrospective single-arm study design (n = 30). Overall, skin, gut, and liver response rates were 72%, 89%, 54%, and 36%, respectively. The pooled steroid-sparing percentage was 66%. ECP showed significantly higher survival in patients with grade 2 GVHD compared with grades 3 and 4 (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.67 - 3.29). ECP demonstrated a positive trend in overall survival compared to other treatments, but the results were not significant. This review indicates that ECP is an effective treatment for SR-aGVHD, with favorable response and survival outcomes. However, due to the heterogeneity observed in the analyses among the studies, more controlled trials are needed to establish its effects in combination with other agents and against other regimens. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42024585471.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

41476963,Pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic potential of the microbiome in premature ovarian insufficiency.,"The postponement of childbearing age has become a global issue. Factors such as increased work pressures on women and environmental changes have led to a rising incidence and younger onset of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI not only impacts patients' reproductive function but also heightens the risk of depression, anxiety, cognitive decline, premature mortality, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Exploring effective prevention and treatment strategies for POI can slow ovarian ageing and safeguard female reproductive health. Microbiome research confirms that most human tissues and organs form dynamic, interactive systems with symbiotic microbes that play a crucial role in female reproductive function. Previous studies on the microbiome and female reproductive health have rarely focused on POI. The proposed 'Microbiota-Ovary Axis' aims to establish an integrated regulatory framework. This theoretical model systematically elucidates how microbial signals influence ovarian function through four core pathways: the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, metabolism and endocrine regulation, immunoregulation, and oxidative stress. Evaluating the efficacy of dietary modifications, probiotics, and microbiota transplantation in animal models and preliminary clinical studies will establish a robust theoretical foundation for developing microbiota-targeted innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for POI, thereby enhancing reproductive health throughout the female lifespan.",2025,Frontiers in immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

41476945,Advances in the clinical application of bispecific antibodies in cancer therapy.,"Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most groundbreaking advancements. However, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is often dominated by various immunosuppressive factors, compromising the efficacy of single-target therapies, leading to non-responsiveness or resistance. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) represent an innovative immunotherapeutic strategy with enormous potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes. Unlike monoclonal antibodies, BsAbs can concurrently inhibit multiple pro-tumor pathways, target immune checkpoints to mitigate resistance, and bind to two distinct antigens, thereby enhancing specificity while minimizing off-target effects. Moreover, BsAbs are more cost-efficient and less toxic compared to the use of two separate monoclonal antibodies in combination. In recent decades, BsAbs have made remarkable progress in clinical development. Several BsAbs, such as blinatumomab, mosunetuzumab, teclistamab, glofitamab, epcoritamab, talquetamab, ivonescimab, cadonilimab, tarlatamab, zenocutuzumab, and catumaxomab, have achieved notable success in clinical trials.

This review aimed to synthesize current scientific evidence on Treatment as Prevention (TasP) and the Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) concept, with a particular focus on prevention strategies utilizing antiretroviral therapy, and to discuss their public health implications. This review also examined the history and key evidence of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and outlined its current role in ROK. A narrative literature review was conducted to evaluate the evidence base and implications of TasP and U=U, summarizing the development, efficacy, and implementation of PrEP in both global and Korean contexts. TasP markedly reduced HIV transmission, confirming its role as a cornerstone prevention strategy. The establishment of the U=U concept helps alleviate stigma and fosters a virtuous cycle that supports the prevention of secondary transmission. PrEP has demonstrated high effectiveness in preventing HIV infection. Notably, recent clinical trials found that long-acting injectable PrEP offers greater convenience, potentially improving adherence and broadening access. In ROK, the nationwide expansion of a government-supported PrEP program in 2025 is expected to lower barriers to testing, care, and medication, thereby facilitating higher uptake in at-risk populations. An integrated prevention framework that combines TasP/U=U with both oral and long-acting PrEP is anticipated to substantially reduce new HIV infections and contribute to achieving the 2030 HIV elimination goals in ROK.",2025,Jugan geon-gang gwa jilbyeong,L1_scientific_engagement

41476747,Default mode network and visual network responsiveness to transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation predict its variable efficacy in primary insomnia disorder.,"Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has been proven effective in treating primary insomnia disorder (PID). However, its efficacy exhibits inter-individual variability. This study aimed to investigate the brain functional mechanisms underlying variable efficacy and to identify potential biomarkers that could predict taVNS efficacy. We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 54 PID patients who received real or sham taVNS to assess brain activity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses. An additional 46 patients receiving real taVNS were recruited to enlarge the treatment cohort, thereby enhancing the statistical power for biomarker identification. Post-treatment, the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (mALFF) of sensorimotor network (SMN), default mode network (DMN), and visual network (VN) in treatment group were significantly increased than those before treatment, and the mALFFs value of the combination of all the differentially significant brain regions (especially DMN + VN) before taVNS were correlated with its efficacy. The heart rate variability indicators ""root mean square of successive differences, percentage of adjacent N-N intervals differing by more than 50 ms, and high frequency (HF) during taVNS were significantly greater than pre-treatment. The mALFFs value of DMN and VN before taVNS were correlated with HF during taVNS. Our findings suggest that taVNS may exerts therapeutic effects in PID through modulating the activities of the DMN (left precuneus and bilateral cuneus), VN (left lingual gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, left cuneus and bilateral calcarine), and SMN (right precentral, right rolandic operculum, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral paracentral gyrus, bilateral supplementary motor areas and left middle cingulate gyrus), thereby regulating the ANS activity in PID patients. Individual differences in functional responsiveness of the DMN + VN + SMN networks, particularly ""DMN (left Precuneus and left cuneus) + VN (left superior occipital and left cuneus)"" to ANS modulation during taVNS were correlated with variability in efficacy. Additionally, baseline DMN/VN activity and HF parameters during stimulation demonstrated potential as predictive biomarkers for taVNS efficacy.

41476723,Nanometer preparation of natural bioactive compounds for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune condition that leads to chronic arthritis, disability, and reduced lifespan. Current therapies show limited effectiveness and often cause severe side effects, with up to 50% of patients discontinuing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) due to unsatisfactory outcomes. Natural bioactive compounds (NBCs), such as glycosides, alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, polyphenols, and coumarins, have gained attention for their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. However, challenges like poor solubility, high dosage requirements, short action duration, and low tissue specificity hinder their clinical use. Nanoparticle (NP)-based delivery systems, including lipid NPs (LNPs), polymer carriers, and inorganic nanocarriers, have been designed to address these challenges through passive, active, and stimuli-responsive strategies. NBC-loaded NPs target immune dysfunction, synovial hyperplasia, bone destruction, angiogenesis, inflammation, and oxidative stress (OS) in RA. This article highlights recent advancements in NBCs for RA treatment, nanoformulation design, and targeted mechanisms, while addressing challenges and future directions in this field. The integration of cutting-edge nanotechnology has demonstrated significant potential to overcome traditional barriers such as low bioavailability and off-target effects through intelligent NPs design. Future research should enhance artificial intelligence (AI)-driven modeling to predict drug-nanocarrier interactions, develop biomarker frameworks for precision nanomedicine, and optimize RA management.",2025,Journal of pharmaceutical analysis,L1_scientific_engagement

41476672,The Landscape of Potential Targeted Treatments and Chemotherapy Efficacy Biomarkers for TNBC.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized as an estrogen receptor (ER) negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) negative disease with an enhanced systemic metastatic incidence, chemotherapeutic insensitivity, and drug resistance. The internal characteristics of TNBC are extraordinary complex and are accompanied by numerous gene mutations and constitutively activated signaling networks, which, in turn, augment TNBC malignancy. There is an urgency to uncover new and potent therapeutic targets for TNBC. Herein, we discussed the historical as well as newly discovered subtypes and properties of TNBC. We also presented a systematic outline of the aberrant gene expression and abnormal activated signaling networks in TNBC. Subsequently, we summarized the corresponding targeted therapeutic drugs, and reviewed the current targeted TNBC therapies launched in clinical trials, thereby providing a direction for future TNBC therapy. We also provided a detailed list of coding genes involved in chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistance of TNBC, which can potentially serve as indicators of chemotherapeutic efficacy. Finally, we discussed the novel and future potential treatments of TNBC.

41476668,Important Aspects of siRNA Design for Optimal Efficacy In Vitro and In Vivo.,"siRNA is a versatile tool with practical applications in various fields, such as fundamental research, therapeutic development, and plant genetics. A few siRNA therapeutics have been FDA-approved, such as Onpattro (patisiran) and Leqvio (inclisiran) to treat hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and primary hypercholesterolemia, respectively. In addition, several others are currently in clinical trials, highlighting the potential of siRNA-based treatment for undruggable targets. siRNA is a double-stranded RNA molecule that has the potential to inhibit gene expression by degrading target mRNA. The siRNA sequence must be precisely designed for effective gene knockdown and to minimize off-target effects. Strategies for designing siRNA to achieve optimal efficacy are presented in this review. We emphasize approaches that promote effective gene knockdown by siRNA. These approaches include preventing off-target RNAi and ensuring incorporation of the intended guide/antisense strand into RISC for targeted gene knockdown. This review also discusses the assessment of siRNA efficacy in vitro and the design of appropriate nonsilencing controls. Furthermore, the challenges of in vivo applications are identified, and strategies to overcome these challenges, such as siRNA delivery methods, biodistribution, and immunotoxicity prevention, are highlighted. Lastly, nucleotide chemical modifications to the ribose sugar and phosphodiester bonds and their effects on siRNA stability, activity, and interaction with the RISC complex are discussed. Overall, this review serves as a guide for well-designed and rigorously tested siRNA sequences, starting from initial in silico design to the application of siRNA for research or development of siRNA-based therapeutics.",2025,International journal of cell biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41476661,Multi-Energy Integrated Photocatalysis for Antitumor Therapy.,"Photocatalysis has been recognized as a promising approach in cancer theranostics over the past years. To enhance therapeutic outcomes and overcome current limitations, significant attention has been directed toward the development of multi-energy integrated photocatalytic systems, particularly piezo-photocatalysts and photothermal-photocatalysts. Piezo-photocatalysis combines the piezoelectric effect with photocatalysis, offering superior efficiency, targeted action, and improved safety compared to traditional photocatalytic methods. By harnessing both mechanical and optical stimuli, this approach enables more precise and effective cancer therapies. On the other hand, photothermal-photocatalysis integrates heat induced by light with photocatalytic reactions, accelerating reaction rates and promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species. The synergistic interaction of heat and photocatalysis enhances tumor cell apoptosis more effectively than either modality alone. This review provides a systemic overview of the emerging multi-energy integrated photocatalytic strategies for cancer treatment. It begins with an exploration of the principles of piezo-photocatalysis and its potential to improve cancer therapies such as piezoelectric-enhanced single-modal photodynamic therapy (PDT), dual-modal sono-photodynamic therapy, and triple-modal hydrodynamic therapy/gas therapy (GT)/chemotherapy. Next, we delve into photothermal-photocatalysis and examine how its integration with additional treatment modalities, such as dual-modal photothermal/photocatalytic therapy (PTT/PCT) and PTT/PDT, can enhance therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss more complex multi-modal treatments, including triple-modal PTT/PCT/chemotherapy, PTT/PCT/chemodynamic therapy (CDT), PTT/PCT/GT, PTT/PCT/immunotherapy (IT) and tetra-modal PTT/PCT/CDT/chemotherapy, PTT/PCT/CDT/ferroptosis therapy (FT), PTT/PCT/FT/IT, and PTT/PCT/GT/IT. Finally, we address the challenges and future directions in advancing these novel therapeutic paradigms.

41476609,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress in non-small cell lung cancer: a review of therapeutic agents, mechanistic insights, and implications for therapy.","Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with therapy resistance significantly hindering treatment efficacy. This review explores the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in NSCLC progression and resistance mechanisms. Under stress conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or therapeutic insult, the UPR balances adaptive survival signaling and apoptotic pathways. Key UPR sensors-PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6-are dysregulated in NSCLC, enabling tumor cells to evade death despite microenvironmental or treatment-induced stress. Preclinical studies highlight therapeutic strategies targeting ER stress through reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, calcium homeostasis disruption, and proteasome inhibition, which shift the UPR toward pro-apoptotic outcomes. Agents such as proteasome inhibitors, natural compounds, and repurposed drugs demonstrate the potential to overcome resistance by enhancing chemosensitivity, reversing chemoresistance, and improving radiosensitivity. Combination therapies synergize ER stress inducers with conventional treatments, leveraging immunogenic cell death (ICD) to augment anti-tumor immunity. However, challenges persist due to the UPR's context-dependent outputs and the gap between preclinical models and clinical applicability. Future directions include optimizing combination regimens, identifying predictive biomarkers, and advancing personalized approaches. Translating these insights into clinical trials is critical to validate ER stress modulation as a viable strategy for improving NSCLC outcomes, offering a promising avenue to address unmet needs in this aggressive malignancy.",2025,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41476599,Circadian and sleep-wake rhythm alterations in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder: biomarkers of prodromal α-synucleinopathy.,"Growing evidence highlights a tight interplay linking circadian and sleep-wake disturbances to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. In α-synucleinopathies, three key points have emerged: (1) circadian and sleep-wake disruptions may increase the risk of neurodegeneration; (2) these alterations reflect widespread dysfunction in neural circuits regulating sleep, wakefulness, and biological rhythms; and (3) the prodromal condition of isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) offers a unique window into early pathological changes, as it is characterized by neurodegeneration in brainstem structures critical for sleep-wake regulation and REM sleep control. Hence, sleep- and circadian-related biomarkers may represent feasible tools for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment across the spectrum of α-synucleinopathies. However, despite their potential, diagnostic or therapeutic pathways grounded in sleep and circadian biology have yet to be systematically explored or validated, and key questions remain, including the trajectories that characterize the clinical progression from iRBD to overt α-synucleinopathies. Key challenges include translational barriers, inter-individual variability in biomarker profiles, and the need for longitudinal studies to define clinically actionable thresholds. Against this backdrop, this mini-review synthesizes current evidence on sleep-wake rhythm alterations in iRBD as a prodromal stage of α-synucleinopathy-driven neurodegeneration. Candidate circadian biomarkers are discussed, including objective parameters from long-term actigraphic monitoring, encompassing rest-activity rhythms modeled with parametric and non-parametric approaches, as well as physiological indicators such as dim light melatonin onset and core body temperature.",2025,Frontiers in neuroscience,L1_scientific_engagement
41476384,Evaluating tools for assessing mental health disorders in perimenopausal women.,"During menopause, changing hormone levels can lead to disturbances in mood and cognitive changes. Early identification and assessment of these symptoms is critical for timely intervention and improved quality of life. Perimenopause describes the phase 4 to 8 years prior to menopause, when menstrual cycles become irregular due to the gradual decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. This process involves changing estradiol and progesterone levels, influenced by reduced inhibin B and increased follicle-stimulating hormone. Initially, women experience changes in menstrual regularity, which later progress to more noticeable issues such as hot flashes, night sweats, and genitourinary discomfort. In addition to physical signs, psychological and cognitive symptoms are recognized. Women in this phase have an increased risk of developing mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, regardless of the existence of prior psychiatric history. These symptoms tend to peak during perimenopause and typically improve after menopause. Women might also experience fluctuations in memory and ability to focus, making daily living more challenging. Recognizing cognitive and emotional changes early is essential; however, symptoms of perimenopause can easily be mistaken for other medical or mental health issues. When these symptoms are overlooked or misdiagnosed, women might face delays in receiving appropriate care, significantly affecting their well-being. This review provides an overview of tools that are currently used to assess mental and cognitive health in perimenopausal women, including general psychiatric screeners (PHQ-9 and GAD-7), menopause-specific tools (MRS, Green Climacteric Scale, and MENQOL), cognitive assessments (MoCA, MMSE, and EMQ-R), and relevant digital or biomarker-based tools. This review highlights existing gaps in the literature, including the discussion of subjective cognitive complaints and hormonally driven mood changes. This study summarizes strengths and limitations relevant to these topics and identifies areas where improved screening could better support women's mental health during the transition to menopause.",2025,International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,L1_scientific_engagement
41476308,"Decompression, decompression plus fusion and decompression plus dynamic stabilization for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis: a network meta-analysis.","Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a common cause of low back pain and lumbar spinal stenosis, necessitating various surgical interventions. Traditional management includes fusion surgery, but recently decompression with or without dynamic stabilization has been explored. However, the relative efficacy and safety of these interventions, including their time-effect relationships, have not been comprehensively evaluated. To systematically assess and compare the effectiveness and safety of decompression alone, decompression plus dynamic stabilization, and decompression plus fusion in patients with low back pain due to DS, and to analyze the time-effect relationship among these interventions over a follow-up period of up to 12 years. A network meta-analysis was conducted involving 10 studies, including 9 randomized controlled trials, with a total of 1052 participants diagnosed with DS. The interventions compared were decompression alone, decompression plus dynamic stabilization, and decompression plus fusion. Primary outcomes included visual analog scale for low back pain (VAS-LBP), visual analog scale for leg pain (VAS-LP), and Oswestry disability Index (ODI). Secondary outcomes were complications, reoperation rate, operation time, and blood loss. We assessed global inconsistency, risk of bias, and conducted a time-effect analysis using the TE-max model. The analysis did not reveal significant global inconsistency or a high risk of bias among the included studies. There were no significant differences between the three interventions regarding changes in VAS-LBP, VAS-LP, and ODI. Decompression alone was associated with significantly shorter operation time (MD = 89.5, 95% CI - 123.91 to - 55.12) and less blood loss (MD = 151.5, 95% CI 37.31 to 265.70) compared to both decompression with fusion and decompression with dynamic stabilization. The time-effect analysis predicted non-inferiority of decompression alone compared to other methods over a follow-up period of up to 12 years. Decompression alone demonstrates non-inferiority in terms of efficacy for treating low back pain due to DS compared to fusion, with additional benefits in operation time and blood loss. The addition of dynamic stabilization to decompression does not yield significant benefits. Further research with larger cohorts and extended follow-up is necessary for definitive conclusions.",2025,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,L1_scientific_engagement
41475978,Combination therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: challenges and opportunities.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a multifactorial metabolic liver disease that occurs in the context of obesity, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic comorbidities. Monotherapy targeting single pathways often provides only partial improvements in histological liver fibrosis and systemic metabolic parameters, prompting growing interest in multitargeted combination therapies. Multitargeted and combination strategies for MASH can modulate multiple and complementary pathogenic processes, potentially improving efficacy, promoting liver fibrosis regression, optimising systemic metabolic outcomes and reducing treatment-related adverse effects. Liver-directed combination therapies, such as thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonists along with acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitors or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, aim to improve histological features of MASH. Regimens combining systemic metabolic and liver-specific agents, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists with fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues or THR-β agonists, aim to optimise metabolic outcomes, including body weight, insulin resistance and plasma lipids. Thoughtfully designed drug pairings, such as diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 inhibitors combined with ACC inhibitors or GLP-1 and glucagon receptor dual agonists, could improve safety and tolerability by leveraging complementary mechanisms that may mitigate adverse effects. These therapeutic strategies aim to achieve more comprehensive and durable improvements in both liver pathology and systemic health than single-agent therapy alone. This review integrates current knowledge on multitargeted and combination therapies for MASH, examines mechanistic rationales and emerging clinical evidence and addresses practical considerations for patient-centred implementation. Therefore, we aim to provide clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive framework to optimise individualised management and improve both hepatic and systemic outcomes in individuals living with MASH.",2025,Gut,L1_scientific_engagement
41475943,"Coronectomy for high-risk mandibular third molars: neuroprotection efficacy, long-term outcomes, and clinical controversies.","Coronectomy, a surgical procedure involving intentional crown removal with root retention of mandibular third molars at high risk of inferior alveolar nerve injury, represents a validated nerve-sparing alternative to complete extraction. This review summarizes evidence demonstrating its superior neuroprotective efficacy: Coronectomy reduces inferior alveolar nerve injury risk by 87% (0%-0.65% vs. 3.7%-19% in conventional extraction), with significantly lower rates of permanent sensory deficit (0.6% vs. 0.9%). Long-term outcomes (>5 years) reveal predictable root migration (>90% of cases; mean 2.5-4.6 mm, predominantly within 6-12 months), minimal chronic pain (0% after 3 years), and enhanced bone regeneration at the distal aspect of adjacent second molars (mean gain: 3.2-3.5 mm). Secondary extraction rates remain low (3.1%-5.4%), primarily indicated for root exposure (2.1%-3.5%) or infection (0.3%-1.6%). Key controversies include the contraindication of routine root canal treatment (failure rate: 87.5% vs. 12.5% without) and emerging two-stage extraction techniques. Strict cone beam computed tomography-guided selection criteria are critical to success. Future priorities include migration prediction models and bioactive material-enhanced healing.

Greater occipital nerve blocks (GONBs) are frequently used in practice; however, the safety and efficacy of steroid-based injections, alone or combined with local anesthetic in CH patients, remain unclear. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid-based GONBs, with or without local anesthetic, in patients with CHs, including ECH and CCH. Outcomes included attack frequency, proportion of responders, duration of effect, pain reduction, and adverse events. We systematically searched Cochrane, Embase, Emcare, PubMed, and PsycInfo from inception to March 24, 2025 for eligible studies involving patients with CHs who received GONBs stratified by corticosteroid use. Data were narratively synthesized, with random-effects meta-analyses performed: a proportional meta-analysis of GONB arms, and a binary meta-analysis of randomized studies comparing GONBs versus control (saline±local anesthetic). Subgroup and risk of bias (RoB) sensitivity analyses were conducted for ECH and CCH. RoB was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 and ROBINS-I tools. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Protocol registered on OSF (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6EAZN). No funding was received. Nineteen studies were included, comprising 758 CHs, 324 ECHs, and 375 CCH patients. All studies suggested improvements in outcomes with particulate steroid-based GONBs. Pooled data showed similar efficacy between single and multiple injections, with mostly minor, transient adverse events and consistent reductions in pain across studies. Mean duration of effect was 43 days (CH), 61.6 days (ECH), and 32.2 days (CCH). Proportional meta-analyses explored probabilities of response: CH=73%, ECH=77%, CCH=69% (I²=86.5%, 47.8%, 89.9%). Sensitivity analyses provided similar estimates: CH=79%, ECH=75%, CCH=70%. Binary meta-analyses showed non-significant reductions in attack frequency for CH (p=0.06) and ECH (p=0.11), and a significant reduction for CCH (p=0.01, relative risk=2.67, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.75). Adverse events did not differ between groups (p=0.43). Particulate steroid-based GONBs show promise for CH treatment by decreasing attack frequency, while mostly producing short-term adverse events.

This study aims to compare international health technology assessment (HTA) and regulatory real-world evidence (RWE) guidance, focusing on their applicability to hospital data. We used a two-step sequential qualitative design: a scoping review and semi-structured interviews with HTA experts. We searched for RWE guidance for HTA in 12 countries: the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Denmark, Canada, the US and Australia, along with the European Medicines Agency and Food and Drug Administration. The expert interviews aimed to validate document selection and assess their applicability to hospital data. We analysed the interviews thematically. We identified 19 guidance documents providing recommendations for RWE. Of these, four documents explicitly provided recommendations tailored to hospital data, while two others did so implicitly. The scope, definition and applications of RWE vary among guidance. Recommendations across all agencies mainly address the clinical-effectiveness domain, with limited guidance on quality-of-life and patient-reported outcomes, and none on real-world cost. The interviews identified seven themes playing a role in using hospital data: data-related, generalisability, ethical/legal, organisational, communication, governance and technology-related. Barriers included data availability, access, timeliness, quality, validation and heterogeneity. HTA experts emphasised the need for standardised policies. There is a lack of harmonisation in assessing RWE among HTA and regulatory agencies. The available RWE guidance documents provide limited guidance on real-world hospital data. Considering their unique nature and to unlock their potential for HTA, we emphasise the need for more in-depth guidance tailored to the hospital context.",2025,BMJ open,L1_scientific_engagement
41475715,Chitosan and chito-oligosaccharides as multifunctional therapeutics for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously called metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has emerged as a leading cause of chronic liver injury worldwide, driven by insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut dysbiosis. Current pharmacotherapies remain limited in efficacy and safety, underscoring the need for alternative strategies. Chitosan and chito-oligosaccharides represent promising candidates owing to their multifunctional bioactivities and excellent safety profiles. Evidence from cellular, animal, and preliminary clinical studies indicates that these compounds exert protective effects through coordinated modulation of multiple pathophysiological pathways. They enhance intestinal barrier function and promote the growth of beneficial gut microbiota, leading to reduced lipopolysaccharide translocation and improved hepatic inflammation via gut-liver axis regulation. Simultaneously, chitosan and chito-oligosaccharides activate AMP-activated protein kinase and PPARαsignaling, inhibit lipogenic enzymes, and upregulate fatty acid oxidation, thereby restoring lipid homeostasis. Their antioxidant capacity is mediated through nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activation, while inflammatory cascades involving NF-κB and cytokine overproduction are suppressed.

We performed a systematic review of buprenorphine's analgesic efficacy and risk of adverse effects. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in July 2024 for studies on buprenorphine administration to palliative care patients. We excluded animal studies, patients without a terminal diagnosis, and studies in children. Our final sample included 15 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), 19 prospective studies, and nine retrospective studies. 14 out of 15 RCTs evaluated buprenorphine's analgesic efficacy. Six RCTs evaluating short-acting use found buprenorphine exhibited comparable efficacy to other short-acting full-opioid agonists (including morphine, tramadol, and fentanyl). Of the five RCTs investigating buprenorphine as a long-acting opioid, four found equal or superior efficacy as compared to long-acting fentanyl, morphine, and oxycodone. All placebo controlled RCTs, as well as prospective and retrospective studies reported that transdermal buprenorphine was significantly effective as a long-acting analgesic. Across all comparisons (short-, long-acting, and placebo), buprenorphine had side effects that were not statistically distinguishable from other full-opioid agonists. Our systematic review found consistent evidence that buprenorphine was comparable to other full opioid agonists when used as both a short-acting and long-acting analgesic for palliative care patients. It also did not display significant differences in risks of adverse effects. Future research is needed to compare alternative delivery, dosing, and duration strategies for palliative care patients, as well as to better evaluate impact on overall patient quality of life and well-being.",2025,Journal of pain and symptom management,L1_scientific_engagement

Emerging evidence highlights the role of the gut microbiome (GM) in influencing treatment responses and modulating gastrointestinal adverse events (GIAEs). Because cancer therapy disrupts GM composition, restoring gut health may help mitigate side effects and support gut-associated immunity. This study aims to systematically evaluate and assess the effectiveness of GM interventions on the occurrence of GIAEs and clinical responses to cancer treatment. Three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library) were systematically searched up to February 2025 for studies assessing gut microbiome interventions during cancer treatment. Risk of bias was evaluated using the EPHPP Quality Assessment Tool. Meta-analyses were conducted in Stata 18® using random-effects models to estimate the pooled relative risk of GM interventions on GIAEs (primary outcome) and objective disease response rates (secondary outcome). Fifty-six studies were included in the systematic review and forty were meta-analysed (n=37 for GIAE outcomes, n=8 for treatment response). GM interventions reduced the overall risk of GIAEs (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.65, I GM interventions show promise in improving cancer care by reducing GIAEs, though evidence for direct effects on treatment response remains limited.

In recent years, a range of intraovarian interventions aimed at modifying ovarian aging- including platelet-rich plasma, autologous stem cell-based approaches, and mitochondrial transfer- have gained clinical and commercial attention. These strategies are supported by biologic hypotheses and early changes in surrogate markers such as anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count, yet their clinical significance remains uncertain. This Views and Reviews critically evaluates the evidence supporting these interventions, emphasizing the distinction between transient follicular activation and true modification of reproductive aging. Clinical data are integrated with emerging mechanistic insights from aging biology, including nutrient-sensing pathways, partial epigenetic reprogramming, and ovarian fibrosis as a modifiable determinant of ovarian function. Across modalities, improvements in surrogate outcomes have not reliably translated into gains in embryo competence, euploidy, or live birth, and safety data remain limited, with procedural and infectious risks that warrant careful consideration. We conclude that routine clinical use of intraovarian aging-targeted interventions is premature. Future progress will require standardized protocols, adequately powered randomized trials with live birth endpoints, and rigorous assessment of both efficacy and risk.",2025,Fertility and sterility,L1_scientific_engagement
41475555,Unveiling the vestibular system's role in anxiety and the promise of electrical vestibular stimulation (VeNS) therapy.,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a chronic and prevalent psychiatric condition affecting approximately 4.05 % of the global population, with a higher incidence in women and early onset in childhood. GAD is associated with significant mental, emotional, and physical impairments, including insomnia, metabolic syndrome, and other psychiatric comorbidities such as depression. Current treatment options include pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), face challenges such as side effects, long treatment durations, and accessibility issues. This review explores the role of the vestibular system in anxiety pathophysiology and examines the potential of electrical vestibular stimulation (VeNS) as a novel, safe, and effective treatment option. While the exact pathophysiology of anxiety remains unclear, recent studies suggest that GAD involves complex neurobiological mechanisms, including dysregulated inhibitory neurotransmission, hyperactivity of the amygdala, and impaired connectivity in anxiety-related neural circuits. The vestibular system has been identified as a critical modulator of emotional and stress responses, with vestibular dysfunction being linked to heightened anxiety levels. VeNS, a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing anxiety symptoms by influencing key brain structures, including the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and locus coeruleus. Clinical trials have shown significant reductions in GAD-7 scores and improvements in sleep and overall quality of life following VeNS treatment. ELECTRICAL: Vestibular stimulation (VeNS) has emerged as a promising, non-invasive therapeutic approach for managing GAD. By targeting the vestibular system's extensive neural connections, VeNS modulates anxiety-related brain regions, regulates stress responses, and enhances emotional well-being. Clinical evidence supports its efficacy in significantly reducing anxiety symptoms and improving sleep quality. Given its favorable safety profile and ease of use, VeNS presents a viable alternative or complementary option to conventional pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for anxiety disorders.",2025,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,L1_scientific_engagement
41475518,Tregs in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT): Suppressing GVHD While Preserving GVL.,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is still a significant challenge for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), resulting in substantial non-relapse mortality. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for modulating immune responses and maintaining tolerance, resulting in a promising therapeutic approach for GVHD management. The purpose of this study is to explore the immunomodulatory effect of Tregs in preventing and managing GVHD without sacrificing the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate that ex vivo-expanded Tregs, derived from donor peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood, effectively reduce GVHD incidence when infused prophylactically. Combination therapies, including Tregs with tacrolimus or invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell activation via α-galactosylceramide, enhance Treg's efficacy and reduce required cell doses. Improved Treg stability and in vivo expansion can be achieved through advanced strategies such as rapamycin-assisted expansion and orthogonal IL-2/IL-2Rβ systems. These findings highlight Tregs' potential to mitigate GVHD without compromising GVL, offering a biologically favorable alternative to traditional immunosuppression. Further randomized trials are needed to standardize protocols and confirm long-term efficacy in the face of challenges in Treg isolation, expansion, optimal dosing, and infusion timing, which will lead to improved transplant outcomes.",2025,Transplantation and cellular therapy,L1_scientific_engagement

Previous Salmonella outbreaks associated with spices have shown that suitable treatments are essential to ensure the safety of black pepper. Salmonella inactivation treatments can be classified into eight major categories. Survival post-treatment and during storage depends on several key factors, including both well-understood and confounding variables. Identifying the critical factors and treatment parameters to predict potential risks and develop inactivation models for risk management strategies is essential for preventing outbreaks. Therefore, all available data on Salmonella reduction treatments and survival studies were evaluated through a systematic review, log-linear regression, and meta-analysis. Publication bias was examined via Begg and Mazumdar's Rank Correlation test, while heterogeneity, identified covariates, and confounding variables were evaluated via meta-regression and subgroup analysis.

41475483,Pathophysiology of Knee Osteoarthritis and Mechanisms of Genicular Artery Embolization for Interventional Radiologists.,"Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common cause of disability worldwide and the prevalence of OA is expected to steadily increase in the coming decades. Current treatment follows a stepwise approach, beginning with conservative measures such as physical therapy and analgesics, progressing to intra-articular injections, and knee arthroplasty reserved for advanced cases. Minimally invasive treatment options are limited and include intra-articular injections which have mixed long-term efficacy. Genicular artery embolization (GAE) is a novel transcatheter technique hypothesized to target pathological synovial and subchondral neovascularization, key drivers of inflammation in symptomatic knee OA. As the research on GAE has steadily increased in the last decade, it is important for interventional radiologists to thoroughly understand the pathophysiology of knee OA and how embolization disrupts the cycle of synovial inflammation and nociceptive signaling. This narrative review will examine the key pathophysiological aspects of knee OA, their relationship to pain generation, and the potential therapeutic role of GAE.",2025,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,L1_scientific_engagement

41475447,RNA G-quadruplexes mediated protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) are stable secondary structures formed by guanine-rich RNA sequences that have emerged as critical regulators of RNA metabolism. The rG4s are widespread in both coding and noncoding RNAs and have been implicated in regulating multiple post-transcriptional processes, including RNA stability, splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear export, localization, and translation. Recent findings reveal that rG4s play pathological roles in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The rG4s function in stress granule dynamics, aberrant phase separation, and the nucleation of pathological protein assemblies, which is implicated in protein co-aggregation and pathological protein aggregation in NDs. Here, we provide an integrated synthesis of how rG4s influence protein aggregation through biophysical, cellular, and molecular mechanisms, with particular emphasis on rG4-driven perturbations of phase separation and aggregation pathways. The rG4s relevant disease pathogenesis, biomarker development, and therapeutic interventions in NDs are discussed. Furthermore, we highlight emerging translational opportunities, including the potential of rG4-targeting small molecules such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and other modulators, which may open new avenues for combating neurodegeneration.",2025,Ageing research reviews,L1_scientific_engagement
41475433,"Endometrial Gastric (Gastrointestinal)-type Mucinous Adenocarcinoma: Diagnostic Criteria, Differential Diagnosis, and Molecular Insights.","Endometrial gastric (gastrointestinal)-type mucinous adenocarcinoma (EGMA) is a rare histologic subtype of endometrial carcinoma that is challenging to recognize as a distinct entity. Mucinous differentiation has been observed in endometrial carcinomas since the 1980s. However, the definitive characterization of endometrial carcinomas with mucinous differentiation has been unclear in the past. Since its formal inclusion in the latest 5th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Female Genital Tumors, and with increasing awareness of this rare entity, more case reports and studies on EGMAs have emerged in the recent years. Some studies sought to understand the expression of gastrointestinal immunohistochemical markers in neoplastic and/or normal endometrium, while others performed comprehensive clinicopathologic characterization of EGMAs, including their molecular characteristics. However, there still exist challenges in the diagnosis of EGMA, with considerable overlaps in morphologic features and immunohistochemical phenotype existing between EGMAs and the other differential diagnoses. This review sought to summarize the known clinical presentation, radiological findings and pathologic features of EGMA to date. We will also discuss in detail the salient differential diagnoses to consider, and evaluate the utility of immunohistochemistry in the workup of this entity.",2025,Human pathology,L1_scientific_engagement
41475422,"Multicenter, double-blind, sham endoscopy-controlled, randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of anti-reflux mucosal ablation for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.","Background and aims Antireflux mucosal ablation (ARMA) is a novel endoscopic technique for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) but has only been assessed in non-controlled studies. The objective of this randomized, controlled study was to evaluate its efficacy in patients with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-responsive GERD. Patients and methods We conducted a double-blind, sham endoscopy-controlled, randomized trial across 12 Spanish hospitals. Adults with PPI-responsive GERD and abnormal esophageal acid exposure (AET>6%) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ARMA or sham endoscopy. The primary outcome was clinical success at 12 months, defined as a ≥50% reduction in the GERD-HRQL score. Inability to discontinue PPIs for symptom assessment was considered a treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included PPI discontinuation, AET, manometric parameters, mucosal healing, and adverse events. Results Of 186 patients screened, 60 were included (ARMA: 31; sham: 29). At 12 months, clinical success was achieved in 16/31 (51.6%) patients in the ARMA group and in 11/29 (37.9%) in the sham group (p=0.29) (risk ratio 1.36; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.42). No significant differences were observed in PPI discontinuation, AET, manometric findings or mucosal healing. Postprocedural pain (27.3% vs 3.3%) and dysphagia (45.5% vs 10%) occurred more frequently in the ARMA group. No severe adverse events were recorded. Conclusions ARMA was not superior to sham endoscopy in improving GERD-related quality of life at 12 months in patients with PPI-responsive GERD and was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events. These findings do not support its implementation in routine clinical practice. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04711655.",2025,Endoscopy,L1_scientific_engagement
41475332,Unraveling ADC resistance in hematologic malignancies: Challenges and new frontiers.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) initiated a pivotal therapeutic strategy in hematologic malignancies, by combining targeted cytotoxicity with high specificity and reduced systemic toxicity. However, despite promising clinical outcomes, resistance to ADCs raises a remarkable challenge, limiting their long-term efficacy. This review explored the multiplex mechanisms underlying ADC resistance emerging in different hematologic cancers, including overexpression of drug efflux pumps, antigen loss or downregulation, impaired intracellular trafficking, and altered apoptotic pathways. The review sheds the light on the role of tumor microenvironment in promoting resistance and hindering the ultimate ADCs efficacy as well as emerging strategies to overcome resistance such as combination therapies, next-generation ADCs, and biomarker-driven patient selection. Understanding the molecular basis of ADC resistance is crucial for optimizing treatment regimens and guiding future therapeutic development in hematologic malignancies.",2025,"Pathology, research and practice",L1_scientific_engagement
41475273,ProAKAP4 as a potential biomarker of fertility and sperm freezability in males of different species - A review.,"In recent years, special attention has been paid to proAKAP4, the precursor of A-kinase anchoring protein 4 (AKAP4), which plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the sperm flagellum. This testis-specific protein forms the fibrous sheath and local signal transduction required for proper sperm capacitation and motility. Highly conserved across species, proAKAP4 levels are strongly correlated with fertility and sperm survivability post-thaw. This review summarizes the biological roles of proAKAP4 and its potential as a semen quality biomarker in various mammalian species, including humans, horses, bulls, boars, dogs, rodents and other species. We discuss structural and molecular aspects of proAKAP4 (e.g., prodomain, PKA interactions, phosphorylation sites), as well as its involvement in key signaling pathways controlling sperm movement, such as the cAMP-PKA cascade and calcium signaling. The review also outlines various methods for measuring proAKAP4, such as ELISA, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Particular attention is given to commercial assays, which allow rapid and species-specific quantification of proAKAP4, independent of seminal plasma or cryoprotectant presence. Although the data are promising, researchers highlight the need for further validation in larger populations under varying environmental conditions. Nonetheless, current findings suggest that proAKAP4 may emerge as a standard marker in andrological diagnostics and a valuable tool for selecting breeding males and optimizing semen cryopreservation procedures.",2025,Reproductive biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41475267,Quinones as promising agents for managing metabolic syndrome: Therapeutic and toxicological considerations.,"Metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, poses significant global health concerns. Quinones, a class of natural and synthetic compounds containing a fully conjugated cyclic unsaturated dione structure, demonstrate cytoprotective activity through redox modulation and antioxidant effects, while their cytotoxicity arises from pro-oxidant behavior and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review explores the therapeutic potential of quinones for metabolic syndrome by examining their chemical structure, pharmacological actions, and interactions with key metabolic pathways. Particular attention is given to their influence on insulin signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid metabolism, and associated metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Evidence from preclinical and early clinical studies indicates that quinones can enhance insulin signaling, improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate lipid metabolism and blood pressure. However, the generation of ROS and associated cytotoxicity present challenges for their clinical application. Key limitations in bioavailability, optimal dosage, pharmacokinetics, and long-term safety also hinder successful translation into clinical practice. Further research is needed to define therapeutic windows, develop improved delivery strategies, and clarify toxicological risks. A better understanding of these factors will be essential for advancing quinones as promising therapeutic candidates for metabolic disorders while ensuring safety and efficacy in future clinical applications.",2025,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,L1_scientific_engagement

This review provides comprehensive insights into its dietary sources, extraction and purification methods, processing effects, and applications in the food industry, highlighting seafood, meat, and organ meats as rich sources with variable content. Emerging non-thermal extraction techniques (e.g., ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis, pulse-electric field) offer improved recovery, while purification ensures high-quality functional taurine, yet thermal and mechanical processing can cause significant losses. Taurine supports antioxidant defense, glucose and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular and liver health, and exhibits modest ergogenic effects. Despite growing demand for taurine-enriched foods in human and pet nutrition, challenges remain in selecting suitable raw materials, and developing diverse, demographic-specific products.

41475190,"Autonomic dysfunctions in psychotic disorders, interaction with antipsychotic intervention and treatment resistance: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis.","Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunctions have been increasingly implicated as a feature of psychoses' pathophysiology. The specificity of these alterations and the role of antipsychotic medication remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, following a predetermined protocol (PROSPERO/CRD42024510812) to assess heart-rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and peripheral biomarkers in psychotic disorders. We searched PubMed and EMBASE from inception until July 2024. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and assessed heterogeneity, publication bias, and risk of bias. Patients with psychosis showed a significant reduction in HRV compared to healthy controls, especially in indices reflecting parasympathetic activity. This result was evident in both treated and untreated patients and was also observed in the comparison between patients with psychosis and affective disorders. Among all antipsychotics, clozapine was associated with the greatest reduction in HRV. EDA and peripheral markers, i.e., alpha amylase and catecholamines, did not show significant differences between patients with psychosis and healthy controls. However, the skin conductance level (SCL) showed a trend to decrease after the introduction of antipsychotics. These results suggest that ANS dysregulations may be a core feature of psychosis, only partially dependent on pharmacological treatment, suggesting a potential primary dysregulation within the Central Autonomic Network. Disruptions in neurotransmitter systems, particularly acetylcholine, may contribute. Autonomic profiling could refine psychiatric diagnosis, helping with tailored interventions. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore their potential in predicting treatment response.",2025,Journal of psychiatric research,L1_scientific_engagement
41475037,Balanced crystalloids versus normal saline for trauma resuscitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Fluid resuscitation is a key element for the management of critical care patients. However, it is uncertain whether balanced crystalloids may be preferred over normal saline (NS) in trauma patients. Therefore, the current meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of balanced crystalloids with NS in trauma resuscitation. The online search for articles relevant to our study objective was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, and Scopus. This search was limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available in English language. The primary outcome of our study was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-free days, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and base deficit. The statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4.1, and bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (ROB-2). Six distinct RCTs involving 1950 trauma patients were included. The pooled analyses revealed that NS was associated with decreased mortality in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients (OR: 1.35; 95 % CI: 1.06 to 1.72; p = 0.02), but not in trauma patients without TBI (OR: 1.17; 95 % CI: 0.47 to 2.90; p = 0.74). Similarly, more ventilator-free days were observed in the NS group than in the balanced crystalloids group among TBI patients (MD: -0.67 days; 95 % CI: -0.86 to -0.48; p < 0.00001), but not in trauma patients without TBI (MD: 3.0 days; 95 % CI: -3.36 to 9.36; p = 0.36). On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in total volume of study fluid administered, AKI incidence and length of ICU stay among patients with or without TBI. In trauma patients with TBI, NS was associated with lower mortality and more ventilator-free days than balanced crystalloids, whereas no significant difference was noted in trauma populations without TBI. Moreover, there was no significant difference between NS and balanced crystalloids in terms of AKI incidence, need for RRT, and ICU stay, suggesting that balanced crystalloids remain a safe and reasonable option for trauma resuscitation.",2025,The American journal of emergency medicine,L1_scientific_engagement

Over the past 12 years, 10 TCEs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and an additional two by the European Medicines Agency. Nine TCEs treat hematologic malignancies, and three target solid tumors. Over 150 TCEs are being investigated in clinical trials, recently also in autoimmune diseases. Here, we discuss the learnings from the 12 approved TCEs. A surprising variety of molecular designs and biochemical characteristics appear suitable for approval. On the clinical side, we review targets, indications, dosing, schedules, side effects, mitigation strategies for adverse events, and efficacy. High flexibility in design and choice of target, scalability, high response rates as a monotherapy in hematologic malignancies, and emerging efficacy against solid tumors and in autoimmune diseases make TCEs an attractive therapeutic modality.",2026,The Journal of experimental medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41474687,Advancement on the Association between Gut Microbiota and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interaction, communication, and the presence of restricted, repetitive behaviors. The rising global prevalence of ASD suggests a multifactorial etiology involving genetic, environmental, and neurodevelopmental factors. This review explores the establishment of the early-life microbiome, highlighting rapid microbial colonization from maternal and environmental sources. Emerging evidence indicates that delivery mode and infant feeding practices may influence ASD susceptibility. Although the concept of a sterile intrauterine environment remains debated, its investigation is valuable. The bidirectional ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"" has emerged as a critical pathway linking gut microbiota and brain function, offering potential therapeutic targets for ASD. Dietary patterns in children with ASD are often characterized by selectivity and restriction, which may disrupt gut microbiota composition and exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, thereby increasing ASD risk. Nutritional interventions and early behavioral therapies are thus essential. The gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet remains controversial, with inconsistent evidence regarding its efficacy. Probiotic supplementation shows strain-specific effects, necessitating rigorous evaluation before clinical application. Given the heterogeneity of ASD, pharmacological treatments have shown limited universal efficacy. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and ASD, evaluates the gut-brain axis as a mechanistic framework, and assesses the therapeutic potential of microbial interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). While promising findings have emerged, further well-designed clinical studies are needed to elucidate the complex etiology of ASD and validate therapeutic strategies.",2025,Annals of nutrition & metabolism,L1_scientific_engagement
41474667,Improving cure rates of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with chimeric antigen receptor T-cells.,"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T) therapy was first approved for the treatment of children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Since then, two additional CAR T products have been approved for adult R/R B-ALL. Through clinical trials and real-world evidence, we have learned that CAR T therapies generally lead to high upfront response rates with usually deep remissions, negative for measurable residual disease (MRD). Despite that, many patients eventually relapse, prompting a need for better prognostication and techniques to prolong remissions and maximize cures. Here, we focus our review on previously known and recently discovered prognostic factors for sustained remissions, and potential avenues for improved cure rates with CAR T therapy for ALL. Lastly, we comment on the importance of removing barriers to accessing CAR T cells for patients with ALL.",2025,Acta haematologica,L1_scientific_engagement
41474600,The challenges with the identification of Parkinson's disease subtypes.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibits distinct phenotypes with specific pathophysiological features. Their definition is essential to inform therapeutic choices and trials design. We searched in September 2025 PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science to review current PD stratifications strategies based on clinical, tissue and imaging biomarkers, highlighting their specific strengths and limitations. We provide an overview on the proposed pathophysiological mechanisms underlying distinct phenotypes and the open challenges in the field. Subtyping of PD based on clinical phenotype is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in understanding its pathological mechanisms and clinical heterogeneity. Identifying distinct PD phenotypes is essential to deliver personalized care and optimize clinical trial design, particularly for disease-modifying therapies. Neurotransmitter-based subtyping (cholinergic/noradrenergic/serotonergic) provides a biologically grounded framework that partially overlaps with anatomical models such as the brain-first/body-first distinction. However, validity of such models is also controversial, especially in more advanced stages of PD where many pathways merge. Integrating multimodal data, including clinical/imaging/biomarker/genetic measures, is crucial to improve stratification accuracy and account for comorbidities/copathology. Future progress relies on hypothesis-supervised data-driven approaches, longitudinal validation, and globally inclusive cohorts to achieve robust, biologically informed, and clinically meaningful PD subtyping.",2025,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,L1_scientific_engagement
41474595,Clinical Research on Treating Sanders Type II and III Calcaneal Fractures With Percutaneous Poking Reduction and Internal Fixation Using a Custom-Made Adjustable Triangular Calcaneal Distractor.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and significance of using an independently designed triangular calcaneal distractor in percutaneous poking reduction and internal fixation for treating Sanders type II and III calcaneal fractures. Forty patients with unilateral closed calcaneal fractures treated at our hospital from May 2021 to May 2022 were selected and randomly divided into a treatment group (20 cases treated with a triangular distractor and closed poking reduction) and a control group (20 cases treated with closed reduction and internal fixation). Standardized postoperative treatment was administered to both groups. The surgical duration, number of fluoroscopic exposures, and postoperative calcaneal height and Böhler's angle at 3 days and 3 months were recorded. In the treatment group, the Böhler angle and the calcaneal height was measured at 3 days and 3months after the operation. There were no statistically significant differences in the calcaneal height or the Böhler angle between the two groups (P > .05). There were also no statistically significant differences in the calcaneal height or the Böhler angle within each group at different time points (P > .05). The treatment group had a shorter surgical duration and only two to three fluoroscopic exposures compared with the control group. The differences between the groups were statistically significant (P < .05). For Sanders type II and III calcaneal fractures, the triangular distractor enables more precise traction reduction and screw placement during poking reduction treatment, helping to shorten the surgical duration and reduce the number of required intraoperative fluoroscopic exposures (lowering the radiation exposure for surgeons and patients).",2025,Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,L1_scientific_engagement
41474570,Comprehensive analysis of factors affecting toxicities and oncological outcomes in head and neck cancer patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.,"There is significant variation in normal tissue toxicity and outcomes in terms of tumor response among patients with the same tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and treatment. The aim of the study was to analyze various patient, tumor, and treatment parameters and evaluate their impact on acute treatment toxicities, as well as the treatment responses in adult head and neck cancer patients. This prospective observational study was conducted between November 2021 and April 2023 at a tertiary cancer care center in South India. For the acute toxicity, data from 108 patients were available for analysis. For the clinical outcome, data from 86 patients were available for analysis. Low hemoglobin levels were predictive of both acute severe dermatitis (<11.15 g/dL; P value of 0.02) and severe mucositis (<11.45 g/dL, P value of 0.01). Other factors associated with severe dermatitis included low serum albumin, high lactate dehydrogenase to albumin ratio, high lean body mass, and elevated body mass index. The use of concurrent chemotherapy and triweekly chemotherapy was independently associated with a higher incidence of severe neutropenia when compared to no chemotherapy or weekly chemotherapy. Low skeletal muscle index, smaller gross tumor volume, and a shorter overall radiotherapy completion time were statistically significant factors correlated with a higher percentage of complete responses. Various patient, tumor, and treatment-related factors significantly influence the severity of toxicities and treatment response outcomes in head and neck cancer patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy.",2025,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,L1_scientific_engagement
41474459,Antimicrobial peptides-based strategies at the frontline in battling the escalating menace of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), continues to threaten global health due to its multidrug resistance and strong biofilm-forming ability. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as promising agents against MRSA biofilms because of their diverse origins, structural versatility, and unique modes of action. Natural AMPs derived from animals, plants, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria primarily act by disrupting bacterial membranes, interfering with quorum sensing, and downregulating biofilm-related genes such as sarA, icaA, and icaD. Synthetic AMPs, designed through computational modeling and machine learning, demonstrate enhanced stability, reduced toxicity, and improved target specificity. Synergistic AMP-antibiotic combinations, including nisin, indolicidin, and α-MSH analogs with β-lactams, significantly improve antibiofilm efficacy and bacterial clearance. Despite these advances, challenges persist due to peptide instability, enzymatic degradation, cytotoxicity, and limited in vivo validation. Recent developments in nanoparticle, hydrogel, coatings, and nanofiber delivery systems have improved AMP bioavailability and controlled release within biofilms. Continued integration of peptide engineering, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics-driven design offers promising solutions for clinical translation. Overall, AMPs represent a frontier in combating MRSA biofilms and antibiotic resistance, with future research focusing on stability enhancement, resistance prevention, and optimized therapeutic delivery.",2025,European journal of microbiology & immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

Diagnostic parameters were synthesized using R Studio's ""Mada"" package with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed via I² statistics. FAPI PET/CT exhibited superior pooled sensitivity (0.918, 95% CI: 0.862-0.953) to FDG PET/CT (0.472, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.309-0.642). FAPI demonstrated lower specificity than FDG (0.464, 95% CI: 0.281-0.647, vs. 0.678, 95% CI: 0.505-0.851). Furthermore, it obtained a higher area under the curve (0.846 vs. 0.627), indicating high overall diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, FAPI demonstrated superior performance in detecting small lesions (≤1 cm) and FDG-negative tumors, particularly in cirrhotic livers. Contrarily, FDG showed better specificity for benign lesions. Across studies, heterogeneity was mainly attributed to lesion size, cirrhosis prevalence, and tracer subtypes. FAPI PET/CT achieved higher sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy than FDG in primary liver cancers, particularly in early-stage and metabolically heterogeneous tumors. FAPI offers transformative potential for clinical use despite its lower specificity in patients with cirrhosis. To optimize integration into diagnostic pathways, standardized protocols and large-scale validation are needed.",2025,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,L1_scientific_engagement

41473784,Lactate and lactylation in intervertebral disc degeneration.,"The unique hypoxic microenvironment of the intervertebral disc, characterized by its avascularity and restricted nutrient exchange, drives a shift in cellular metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis. This metabolic adaptation results in the accumulation of significant lactate levels. Increasing evidence indicates that lactate plays a pivotal role in regulating cell differentiation and fate in both physiological and pathological contexts, particularly in complex conditions such as degenerative diseases and cancer. Lactate is not merely a metabolic byproduct; it also modulates cellular signaling pathways and promotes lactylation. In the lactate-enriched microenvironment of the intervertebral disc, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of lactate and lactylation is essential for mitigating intervertebral disc degeneration and improving therapeutic outcomes. Targeting lactate production and transport-particularly through lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs)-holds significant therapeutic promise. This review highlights the critical role of lactate in intervertebral disc degeneration progression and discusses potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating lactate metabolism to enhance treatment efficacy.",2025,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,L1_scientific_engagement

At present, many drugs have been used to treat leishmaniasis. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of different drugs to treat leishmaniasis through a network meta-analysis. All studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, and the search time was from the date of database establishment to February 21, 2024. We assessed rates of clinical cure, mortality, and adverse effects (diarrhea, vomiting, injection site pain, and liver-enzyme abnormalities). We performed subgroup analyses of rates of clinical cure according to geographic region. All statistical analyses were performed using R and STATA 14.0 software for network meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42023478585. 12 articles with 2483 patients were included in this study, and the therapeutic effects of 5 drugs were evaluated. The results of the network Meta-analysis showed that the clinical cure rate of miltefosine, pentavalent antimony, and paromomycin was inferior to amphotericin B (RR 0.31; 95%CI 0.07-11.4, RR 0.23; 95%CI 0.04-1.39, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.01-1.55), and amphotericin B may have the highest clinical cure rate. The mortality of pentavalent antimony was higher than that of amphotericin B and miltefosine (RR 4.81; 95%CI 0.42-41.45, RR 3.75; 95% CI 0.57-24.74), pentavalent antimony may be the drug with the highest mortality during treatment. About adverse effects, vomiting, and diarrhea were most common with miltefosine, and pain at the injection site and abnormalities in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were most common with paromomycin. Subgroup analysis showed that clinical cure rates using Pentavalent antimony treatment were better in Brazil than in Ethiopia and India. This systematic review and network meta-analysis provide a new comparative framework for the clinical management of leishmaniasis. The results of network meta-analysis suggest that amphotericin B may be the first choice for the treatment of leishmaniasis, pentavalent antimony may be the drug with the highest mortality during treatment, miltefosine causes the highest incidence of gastrointestinal reactions, and paromomycin causes the highest incidence of injection site pain, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase abnormalities.

This review systematically analyzes the molecular mechanisms of five core DDR pathways (Homologous Recombination Repair, Non-Homologous End Joining, Base Excision Repair, Nucleotide Excision Repair, and Mismatch Repair) in mediating chemotherapy resistance in tumors, and thoroughly elucidates the correlation between key molecular events-such as BRCA1/2 deficiency, MMR functional abnormalities, and Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated/Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATM/ATR) signaling pathway dysregulation-and chemotherapy sensitivity. The DDR deficiency biomarker system established through the integration of multi-omics data provides molecular classification tools for predicting the efficacy of platinum-based drugs. This study focuses on the mechanism by which Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase inhibitors reverse Homologous Recombination-Deficient tumor resistance through ""synthetic lethality"" effects while also revealing the synergistic anti-tumor effects of ATM/ATR inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. The research presents an innovative molecular synergy model between DDR regulation and Immune Checkpoint Blockade, confirming that tumor neoantigen release induced by DDR deficiency can enhance immunotherapy responses. This article also provides perspectives on multidimensional intervention strategies based on the DDR network, including the development of inhibitors targeting novel DDR targets, the establishment of DDR pathway functional assessment systems based on multidimensional biomarkers, and the investigation of synergistic paradigms between DDR and novel therapeutic modalities. Additionally, we explore the dynamic evolution mechanisms of DDR-mediated chemotherapy resistance by analyzing the interactions between DDR and metabolic reprogramming, as well as other related processes.

41473657,The efficacy versus evidence quality of multicompomnent exercise for cognitive health in older adults: an umbrella review.,"Multicomponent exercise (MCE) is a promising strategy for enhancing cognitive function in older adults. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize and critically appraise the evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effects of multicomponent physical exercise on cognition in this population. An umbrella review of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis was conducted. Six electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched from their inception to September 2025 to identify eligible studies. The methodological quality of the included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool, and the overall certainty of the evidence for key outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE framework. The synthesis included 27 systematic reviews. MCE demonstrated consistently statistically significant, moderate positive effects on global cognitive function (SMD = 0.45) and executive function (SMD = 0.31). regarding memory, while the overall effect and verbal memory showed significant improvements, specific sub-domains such as working memory and delayed memory did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, no significant effect was observed for attention/processing speed. Despite these positive findings, the methodological quality of the majority of the included reviews (22 of 27) was rated as ""Low"" or ""Critically Low"" by AMSTAR-2. Consequently, the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE was predominantly ""Low"" to ""Very Low"" for most cognitive outcomes, with ""Moderate"" certainty achieved only for global cognitive function. Multicomponent exercise is an effective intervention for improving global cognitive function and executive function in older adults. While benefits for specific memory domains and processing speed were less consistent, these findings support the clinical and public health promotion of MCE, while simultaneously highlighting an urgent need for more methodologically rigorous research to solidify the evidence base. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/ CRD420251161230, identifier CRD420251161230.",2025,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,L1_scientific_engagement
41473606,Metal Nanoparticles: From Endophytic Fungi-Mediated Biosynthesis to Their Therapeutic Applications in Oncology.,"Metal nanoparticles possess unique properties and usage patterns compared to traditional materials owing to their distinctive structures. In recent years, their application scenarios and dosages have considerably expanded. Biosynthetic nanoparticles, particularly those derived from endophytic fungi that help host organisms in adapting to heavy metal environments, hold substantial value and potential for application. This is largely attributed to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and energy efficiency. The present review provides an overview of the entire process of metal nanoparticle biosynthesis by plant endophytic fungi and illustrates various scenarios of their applications in oncology treatment. In addition to focusing on the preparation of metal nanoparticles using plant endophytic fungi, this review also explores the characterization of these nanoparticles and clarifies the synthesis mechanisms, including the synthetic pathways and the roles of fungal enzymes. It also comprehensively summarizes the application of biosynthetic metal nanoparticles in cancer, covering their role in diagnosis, enhancement of drug biocompatibility, and improvement of therapeutic efficacy.

41473600,The Neuroimmune Axis in Atopic Dermatitis: From Pathogenic Mechanisms to Targeted Neuroimmunotherapy.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease in which intense pruritus and eczematous lesions arise from tightly coupled disturbances of the nervous and immune systems. Emerging evidence indicates that a dysregulated neuroimmune axis-as reflected by peripheral neuronal sensitization, epidermal barrier dysfunction, and central itch processing-plays a central role in disease onset, persistence, and clinical heterogeneity. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on the neuroimmune mechanisms that drive AD, focusing on how cytokines such as IL-31, IL-4/IL-13, TSLP and IL-33, together with neuropeptides including substance P, CGRP and VIP, establish self-reinforcing itch-scratch and inflammation loops at the level of the skin and the central nervous system. We then highlight recent multi-omics and systems biology approaches, including single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, neuroimaging, and microbiome profiling, that have reshaped the understanding of neuroimmune ""neighbourhoods"" and the gut-skin-brain axis in AD. Building on these mechanistic insights, we summarize key neuroimmune biomarkers-such as NGF, IL-31, TARC/CCL17, S100 proteins, barrier-related lipids, neurofunctional readouts from fMRI, and microbial signatures-and discuss their potential for improving diagnosis, patient stratification, and treatment monitoring within a precision medicine framework. Finally, we review established and emerging neuroimmune-targeted therapies, including IL-4/IL-13 and IL-31 pathway inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, OX40/OX40L-directed biologics, TRP and NK1R antagonists, phototherapy, and microbiome-based interventions, with a particular emphasis on biomarker-guided sequencing and combination strategies. Overall, we propose that positioning the neuroimmune axis at the core of AD pathogenesis provides a conceptual basis for developing stratified, durable, and patient-centred neuroimmunotherapy, while also outlining the remaining challenges regarding clinical validation of biomarkers, long-term safety, accessibility, and implementation across diverse patient populations.",2025,Journal of inflammation research,L1_scientific_engagement
41473524,Resistance training for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Depression is a prevalent and disabling mental disorder worldwide. Resistance training (RT) has emerged as a promising adjunct intervention, but comprehensive quantitative synthesis on its efficacy and optimal exercise prescription remains limited. To evaluate the effects of RT on depressive symptoms in adults with a clinically diagnosed depressive disorder, and to explore-exploratorily-whether participant characteristics and prescription components modify outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and CNKI from inception through August 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RT to a non-exercise control in adults with depression (PROSPERO CRD42024583413). Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data in accordance with PRISMA 2020. Depression outcomes were pooled as standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model, with unit-of-analysis safeguards for multi-arm trials. Pre-specified exploratory analyses evaluated potential effect modifiers (e.g., clinical phenotype [primary vs. comorbid], training frequency, age, baseline severity, duration, intensity, weekly volume). Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane tool; publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot and Begg's test, noting limited power with this study count. Sensitivity analyses included exclusion of high-risk studies and leave-one-out influence checks to test robustness. Twenty-nine RCTs ( RT meaningfully reduces depressive symptoms in adults with clinically diagnosed depression. Given substantial heterogeneity and measurement (self-report vs. observer-rated) and clinical (primary vs. comorbid) variability, any apparent effect modifiers are interpreted cautiously and considered exploratory/hypothesis-generating. To improve precision and implementation, future trials should standardize supervision/adherence reporting (e.g., TIDieR/CERT) and include preregistered follow-ups (3-12 months) to assess durability, while training-prescription guidance remains preliminary pending better-reported, preregistered studies.

41473259,Nutrient-stimulated Hormone-based Therapies: A New Frontier in the Prevention and Management of MASH-associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is now the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world, driven by obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), can culminate in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While lifestyle modification remains central to MASLD management, there is growing interest in pharmacological interventions, particularly nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies (NuSHs), such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. NuSHs exert metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily via weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity. Emerging clinical data support their efficacy in resolving MASH without worsening fibrosis. However, benefits in cirrhotic patients are less evident, suggesting greater utility in early intervention. Observational studies and clinical trials suggest a reduction in liver-related morbidity with GLP-1 receptor agonist use, though fibrosis regression remains inconsistent. Preclinical models indicate that NuSHs may also reduce MASH-related HCC incidence and tumor burden, likely through systemic metabolic improvements rather than direct antineoplastic action. Observational human data following bariatric surgery reinforce this link, suggesting that weight loss itself plays a key preventive role. Herein, we propose that NuSHs are promising candidates for MASH-related HCC prevention. We provide mechanistic suggestions for how this may occur. Furthermore, incorporating NuSHs into the post-locoregional treatment pathway for HCC may delay the need for systemic anti-cancer therapies, improve immunotherapy synergy and transplant eligibility, and even slow disease progression through reversal of carcinogenic drivers. Future studies are needed to target oncological endpoints and clarify immunometabolic mechanisms to guide the integration of NuSHs into MASLD treatment algorithms.",2025,Journal of clinical and translational hepatology,L1_scientific_engagement

Early-stage diagnosis remains challenging due to its asymptomatic onset and the limited sensitivity of conventional biomarkers, which together contribute to delayed detection, suboptimal therapeutic outcomes, and poor prognosis. These limitations underscore the urgent need for reliable, sensitive, and specific biomarkers to enable timely detection and targeted intervention. Protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, an abnormal prothrombin variant generated under vitamin K deficiency or antagonism, has emerged as a promising candidate with diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in HCC. This review critically examines the molecular and biological characteristics of protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II, evaluates its clinical utility in HCC diagnosis and management, and delineates the current limitations hindering its broader application. Furthermore, future perspectives are proposed to guide translational research and clinical implementation.

Recently, food-medicine homologous (FMH) substances have gained attention as adjunctive therapies due to their multi-target effects, low toxicity, and favorable safety profiles. As the ""food as medicine"" paradigm integrates into health policies, a comprehensive understanding of FMH in lung cancer therapy as a form of nutrition-based adjuvant therapy is increasingly relevant and timely. This review summarizes the anti-lung cancer mechanisms of FMH-derived bioactive compounds-such as polysaccharides, saponins, polyphenols, alkaloids, and essential oils-focusing on their roles in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis induction, immune modulation, and resistance reversal. To address poor bioavailability, we highlight recent advances in nanodelivery systems that enhance therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, we examine nutritional modulation of gut microbiota under the gut-lung axis framework as a novel strategy in lung cancer treatment. By integrating preclinical evidence with translational studies, this review evaluates the clinical potential and future directions of FMH-based therapies.

Systemic chemotherapy has improved survival compared to supportive care; however, overall survival worldwide remained limited to approximately 1 year. Recently, the introduction of upfront immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and/or targeted agents in biomarker-enriched populations has led to clinically meaningful survival improvements. The expansion of treatment options for metastatic disease, combined with the identification of biomarker-selected populations, underscores the importance of tailoring first-line, maintenance, and sequential therapies across multiple lines. In this context, the delivery of an effective first-line treatment is crucial, as less than half of patients retain fitness for additional anti-cancer therapies due to the morbidity associated with disease progression to the initial regimen even within modern clinical trials regardless of the use of targeted therapy or immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy. On the other hand, the expanding therapeutic armamentarium including ICIs, antibody-drug conjugates, and targeted therapies for molecularly selected subgroups, will enable the development of sequential treatment strategies across multiple lines of therapy.

41472886,Systematic review on biomarker potential of vitreous microRNA in retinal disease.,"The vitreous fluid, situated in the posterior chamber of the eye, holds a close relationship with the inner retina. Within this milieu, retinal cells secrete a diverse array of biomolecules, potentially harboring vital biomarkers. Among these, short, non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNAs) emerge as promising candidates. Their dynamic regulation by various gene signaling mechanisms, enhanced resistance to degradation, and secretion via separate exocytotic pathways make them particularly significant. Alterations in vitreal miRNA profiles may reflect pathological states and offer insights into disease etiology and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 22 peer-reviewed studies to assess the potential of vitreous miRNAs as biomarkers for retinal diseases. Our analysis demonstrates the utility of miRNAs as biomarkers in specific retinal pathologies. We show that miR-142, miR-9, and miR-21 are robust biomarker candidates, displaying consistent and significant alterations correlating with proliferative vitreoretinal diseases. We also address the methodological challenges encountered in characterizing vitreous miRNA content, including the absence of standardized purification, amplification, and analysis protocols, as well as the scarcity of true control samples. Moreover, we recommend the adoption of specific housekeeping genes and data normalization techniques to standardize miRNA analysis in the vitreous and explore potential methodologies for obtaining vitreous samples from healthy individuals. We conclude that vitreous miRNAs hold promise as potential biomarkers for various retinal diseases, with miR-142, miR-9, and miR-21 emerging as promising candidates.

While AI-based retinal imaging predicts CHD risk, links between CHD lesion complexity and retinopathy, and potential benefits of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors on retinopathy in CHD patients with T2DM, lack sufficient evidence. This case-control study (Jan 2024-Mar 2025) enrolled 642 subjects from Beijing Tongren Hospital (affiliated with Capital Medical University). Retinal imaging data were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) created baseline and optimized datasets. Univariate/multivariate logistic regression assessed if CHD increases retinopathy risk in patients with T2DM, HTN, or both. Pearson correlation evaluated associations between CHD lesion complexity (SYNTAX score) and retinal parameters. Stratified analysis assessed SGLT2 inhibitor effects on retinopathy in hypertensive-diabetic subgroups with/without CHD. The analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor efficacy was based on a retrospective cohort study of drug utilization rather than a prospective randomized intervention.

Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance plays a crucial role in the progression of sepsis. This review identifies the core mechanisms of GM imbalance: it disrupts the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, induces bacterial and endotoxin translocation, activates systemic inflammatory responses, and forms a vicious cycle of ""gut-organ"" cross-damage, becoming a key driver of sepsis-associated multi-organ dysfunction. Existing research has confirmed that microbiota modulation strategies, such as probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have potential therapeutic value. However, due to issues like strain specificity, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient clinical evidence, the clinical translation of these strategies still faces significant barriers. Therefore, future research should focus on the identification of sepsis-specific GM core functional biomarkers, the development of personalized combined regulatory strategies, and the advancement of targeted delivery technologies. Multi-center large-scale clinical trials are needed to validate their efficacy and safety, providing innovative solutions for precision treatment of sepsis.",2025,Frontiers in microbiology,L1_scientific_engagement

41472733,Anti-inflammatory effects of natural polysaccharides: molecular mechanisms and nanotherapeutic applications.,"Chronic excessive inflammation drives the pathogenesis of diseases such as Heart Failure (HF) and arthritis. Natural polysaccharides, with low toxicity and biodegradability, exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating core inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g., Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB), Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)) and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines including Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and IL-6. But their poor water solubility and easy breakdown by digestive enzymes limit bioavailability. Nanonization solves these problems by enhancing aqueous dispersibility, reducing enzymatic hydrolysis, and improving targeting efficiency (passive via the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR) effect, active via ligand modification). It also strengthens the inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways, activates the Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2)/Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) antioxidant pathway, and protects the mucosal barrier. This review is divided into four logical sections-fundamental mechanisms of inflammation and polysaccharide regulation, anti-inflammatory activities of natural polysaccharides, nanonization strategies for efficacy enhancement, and clinical translation potential.

However, the clinical implementation of microbiome-inspired therapies that leverage these associations have proven challenging. Probiotics-live microorganisms thought to confer health benefits as part of food or food supplements-have gained increasing attention as readily testable, low-toxicity agents with potential of favorably influencing host-microbiome-immune interactions in the context of cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we critically evaluate the growing body of evidence supporting the role of probiotics in enhancing ICI efficacy and summarize published and ongoing clinical trials formally testing their role as adjuncts to cancer immunotherapy. Probiotics have been shown in preclinical murine models to exert immunomodulatory effects, including activation and maturation of dendritic cells, enhancement of MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation, modulation of cytokine profiles, and promotion of pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Probiotics also regulate adaptive immunity via microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), inosine, and tryptophan derivatives that support effector T cell activation and reduce T cell exhaustion.

The pathologic process of OA is multifaceted, and while traditional interventions offer only symptom relief, novel approaches, such as autologous conditioned serum (ACS) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, are showing greater promise. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The primary outcomes were changes in pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) and functional status (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC). Relief from pain in the long term was greater with ACS than the PRP group, with better VAS score improvements at three months (p<0.001), six months (p=0.03), and the 24-month mark (p<0.001). WOMAC score evaluations demonstrated ACS had significant differences for functional recovery, along with sustained functional improvement at three months (p<0.001) and six months (p<0.001). The results obtained indicate that some patients with knee OA can obtain sustained relief from pain and improve function more than one year after treatment with anti-inflammatory ACS. Sustained pain relief and functional recovery are also likely due to regulatory mechanisms on inflammation and homeostasis of the joint. This meta-analysis indicates that ACS is more effective than PRP in relieving pain and improving joint function in knee OA. Further studies should be directed towards standardization of protocols, determining the cost, and looking at other outcomes over longer periods to better understand the benefits and refine the clinical use.",2025,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,L1_scientific_engagement
41472521,The role of interleukin-15 in the spectrum of inflammatory diseases.,"Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine, constitutively expressed in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. The role of IL-15 during systemic inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders, is to be fully clarified yet. Due to its effects on immune cells, IL-15 has attracted attention as a potential new therapeutic target for modulating immune responses, either by enhancing immune surveillance or by controlling excessive inflammation. We provided a landscape about IL-15 in systemic inflammatory diseases, from its biological functions to the possible mechanistic roles, using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Still's disease as autoimmune and autoinflammatory models, respectively. IL-15 exerts its pathogenetic activity by the induction of a deregulated activation of innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, at the crossroad of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. During RA, IL-15 mediates the production from T cells and macrophages of TNF, which may induce further production of IL-15 by synoviocytes via a vicious pathogenic loop. During Still's disease, together with IFN-I, IL-15 promotes the expansion of NK cells and of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells, which are highly activated in disease life-threatening evolution. Thus, novel IL-15-targeted therapeutic strategies could be explored to improve the management of systemic inflammatory diseases.",2025,Expert review of clinical immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

41472447,Mass spectrometry approaches for monitoring therapeutic response in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and disabling psychiatric condition, often chronic and recurrent, for which treatment selection remains largely guided by trial-and-error. Objective biomarkers capable of predicting and monitoring therapeutic response are urgently needed to enable personalized interventions and reduce exposure of the patients to ineffective treatments. Mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a central analytical technique, providing the sensitivity and specificity required to capture multi-parametric molecular signatures in biofluids such as plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine. In this context, this review summarizes the application of MS-based platforms to characterize molecular changes associated with treatment response in MDD and discusses how integrative multi-omics approaches can generate robust insights into treatment efficacy and resistance. We highlight current applications, discuss opportunities for MS-guided monitoring of therapeutic strategies, and outline how convergent molecular signatures may accelerate the development of clinically informative biomarkers for precision psychiatry in MDD. Major depressive disorder, also called depression, is a serious and long-lasting mental health condition. Today, doctors still choose treatments mostly by trial and error. As a result, many people try several medicines before finding one that works. Researchers want to change this. They are looking for biological signatures. These are molecules in the body that change when someone has a disease or responds to a treatment. If doctors could measure these molecules, they might be able to tell which treatment will help a person before they start it. This review explains how a laboratory technique called mass spectrometry can help. This technique can measure many types of molecules in body fluids such as blood, spinal fluid, and urine. When studying these molecules, scientists can find patterns that show whether a treatment is likely to work. The review also describes how different kinds of biological information, such as genes, proteins, and small molecules called metabolites, can be studied together. Looking at these data at the same time can give a clearer picture of why some people respond to treatment and others do not. In summary, the article shows how mass spectrometry and combined biological data may help create reliable biological signatures. Hopefully one day, these signatures could guide more personalized and effective treatments for people with depression.",2025,Bioanalysis,L1_scientific_engagement

This review articulates a countermeasure strategy for emerging and engineered viruses leveraging the programmable CRISPR modality. Building on mounting in vitro and in vivo evidence that Cas9 degrades DNA viruses (e.g., Orthopoxviruses, HSV-1, ASFV), while Cas13 targets RNA viral genomes (e.g., Influenza A, Dengue, RSV), both leading to reduced viremia, diminished disease burden, and alleviated symptoms. Here, we outline a rapid-response pipeline to position CRISPR-based countermeasures in translational and pandemic-response frameworks, linking real-time sequencing to AI-assisted gRNA selection and multiplexed cassette design to achieve viral targeting efficacy. To minimize resistance and off-target risk, we emphasize multi-gRNA cocktails, continuous genomic surveillance, and adaptive gRNA rotation. We also propose governance mechanisms, such as pre-cleared gRNA repositories, transparent design logs, standardized off-target/safety screening, and alignment with evolving nucleic-acid-synthesis screening frameworks to enable emergency deployment while preserving security. Furthermore, compressing the time from sequence to treatment and complementary to vaccines and small-molecule antivirals, CRISPR represents a technologically agile and strategically essential capability to combat both natural outbreaks and AI-enabled biothreats.

There are some unconventional and conventional treatments for cancer. Typically, they span a wide spectrum of conventional and advanced therapeutic approaches, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT). This has long been valued for its non-invasive, targeted, and minimally toxic approach in the management of cancer. More importantly, PDT results in fewer operative and post-operative major complications, faster recovery times, reduced operating time, and saved costs. There are two types of photosensitizers in PDT, including synthetics (e.g., hematoporphyrin derivative, photofrin II, verteporfin) and natural (e.g., Hypocrellin A (HA) and Hypocrellin B (HB)). Nine electronic databases-WanFang Data, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, SciFinder, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI)-were systematically searched for this review, covering the literature published within the past 20 to 30 years (time range), without language restrictions.

41471328,Insight into the Anticancer Potential of Imidazole-Based Derivatives Targeting Receptor Tyrosine Kinases.,"Kinases, which make up 20% of the druggable genome, are thought to be essential signaling enzymes. Protein phosphorylation is induced by protein kinases. Proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis, motility, growth, differentiation, and other biological processes are all regulated by kinases. Their dysregulation disrupts several cellular functions, leading to a variety of illnesses, the most important of which is cancer. As a result, kinases are thought to be crucial targets in a number of malignancies and other diseases. Researchers from all over the world are hard at work developing inhibitors using various chemical structures. The scaffolds of imidazole and benzimidazole provide a versatile structure for a variety of physiologically active substances. Moreover, they serve as specialized scaffolding for the creation of target-specific pharmaceuticals to address various diseases. This article seeks to illustrate the application of imidazole and benzimidazole frameworks in the formulation of inhibitors that target various tyrosine kinases, including fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), c-Met kinase, epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs), and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), from 2020 to the present. The major structure-activity correlations (SARs) of imidazole and benzimidazole derivatives were examined, and, also, a docking study highlighted the varied interactions occurring inside the active site of tyrosine protein kinases. The objective of this effort is to consolidate the fundamental structural information necessary for the synthesis of imidazole- or benzimidazole-based tyrosine kinase inhibitors with enhanced efficacy.",2025,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41471322,Advances in Therapeutics Research for Demyelinating Diseases.,"Demyelinating diseases comprise a group of chronic and debilitating neurological disorders, with the destruction of the myelin sheath serving as the core pathological hallmark. The central pathogenesis involves immune-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes (Ols) and myelin breakdown, accompanied by a vicious cycle of neuroinflammation and impaired epigenetic repair. Current therapeutic strategies, including conventional immunomodulatory agents to targeted monoclonal antibodies, effectively control disease relapses but exhibit limited efficacy in promoting neural repair. Consequently, research focus is increasingly shifting towards neuroprotective and remyelination strategies. In this context, Emerging therapeutic promise stems primarily from two fronts: the advent of novel pharmaceuticals, such as remyelination-promoting drugs targeting oligodendrocyte maturation, interventions inhibiting epigenetic silencing, signal pathway inhibitors, and natural products derived from traditional Chinese medicine; the development of innovative technologies, including cell therapies, gene therapy, exosome and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, as well as extracellular protein degradation platforms. Nevertheless, drug development still faces challenges such as disease heterogeneity, limited blood-brain barrier penetration, long-term safety, and difficulties in translating findings from preclinical models. Future efforts should emphasize precision medicine, multi-target synergistic therapies, and the development of intelligent delivery systems, with the ultimate goal of achieving a paradigm shift from delaying disability progression to functional neural reconstruction.",2025,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Within this framework, cytoprotection serves as the unifying principle, underscoring that therapeutic effects are not isolated but interconnected. Preclinical studies with BPC 157 therapy, as a cytoprotection agent, illustrate this integration. BPC 157 rapidly normalizes elevated intraocular pressure in glaucomatous rats, preserves retinal integrity, restores pupil function, maintains corneal transparency during ulcer or abrasion healing, and counteracts both corneal neovascularization and dry eye. In parallel, its consistent efficacy in tendon injury models highlights a cytoprotective specificity across avascular tissues. The cornea's ""angiogenic privilege,"" preserved during healing and tendon recovery together, provides strong proof of concept. Furthermore, mapping standard therapeutic agents used for corneal ulcers, neovascularization, or glaucoma onto this triad, and linking them with tendon healing, reveals both shared pathways and inconsistencies across existing drug classes. Analyzed were the ascorbate, fibronectin, hyaluronic acid, metalloproteinase inhibitors, EGF, FGF, NGF, insulin, and IGF-1 (corneal ulcer healing), the antiangiogenic agents (endostatin, PAI-1, PEDF, angiostatin, TSP-1, TSP-2, IFN-α), corticosteroids, NSAIDs, cyclosporine A, anti-VEGF drops (treatment of corneal neovascularization), and alpha 2-agonists, beta-blockers, carboanhydrase inhibitors, muscarinic agonists, Rho-kinase inhibitors, and prostaglandin analogs (glaucoma).

This article compiles mechanistic and translational data on curcumin and its analogs as multi-organ regulators targeting this axis. Curcumin plays a pleiotropic role by modulating adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and thermogenic remodeling in adipose tissue, tailoring gut microbial diversity, gut barrier integrity, and metabolic endotoxemia. Curcumin in the liver attenuates steatosis, oxidation, and fibrosis by inhibiting lipogenesis, increasing β-oxidation, and modulating the NF-κB and TGF-β signal pathways. These actions result in overall systemic insulin sensitivity and energy balance. On the contrary, the clinical application of curcumin is restricted due to its low solubility, instability, and poor bioavailability. New formulations (nanoparticles/liposomes/micelles) together with structurally enhanced analogs such as tetrahydrocurcumin and monocarbonyl analogs (C66, B2BrBC) exhibited superior pharmacokinetic and tissue-targeting properties in preclinical models. Pilot and randomized clinical trials suggest that curcumin supplementation enhances glucose and lipid metabolism, reduces liver fat content, and modulates inflammatory markers; however, results across studies remain heterogeneous. Large, high-quality multicenter trials using rigorously standardized, bioavailable curcumin formulations are still required to reliably establish the efficacy and safety of curcumin in metabolic diseases. Next steps involve comparing curcumin analogs, conducting multi-omics analyses to understand host-microbiota-organ crosstalk, and determining cooperative approaches with lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Taken together, curcumin and its next-generation derivatives may offer a novel therapeutic approach to intervene in the adipose tissue-gut-liver axis for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic diseases.",2025,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

OROV is also neuroinvasive, with a small number of cases presenting severe neurological symptoms. There have been recently reported deaths from confirmed cases of OROV and reported instances of vertical transmission from mother to foetus, with confirmed cases in Brazil and a congenital anomaly, reportedly as a consequence of OROV infection in Cuba, with further cases under investigation. Whilst cases of OROV infection occur mainly in South America, many cases have been imported elsewhere, including the United States and Europe. Despite the emerging threat to public health, animal modelling to study OROV pathogenicity and immunity and to evaluate therapeutic candidates remains limited. For this review, we carried out a literature search through major research databases (PubMed and Scopus) up to September 2025 to capture the extent of in vivo model development for this pathogen. We identified only 17 relevant primary research articles within these criteria which detailed hamster, mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models. Here, we discuss the extent of in vivo model development for OROV. In summary, small and large animal models need to be assessed with recent clinical isolates and reassortants, asymptomatic disease presentation in the NHP model requires further study and the hamster model shows potential for use in pathogenicity and vaccine or antiviral efficacy studies.

Early precise diagnosis and the development of efficient treatment regimens remain major clinical challenges. Harnessing the programmable size, surface chemistry, and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness of nanomaterials, there is tremendous potential for their applications in breast cancer diagnosis and therapy. In the diagnostic arena, nanomaterials serve as core components of novel contrast agents (e.g., gold nanorods, quantum dots, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) and biosensing platforms, substantially enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of molecular imaging modalities-such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and fluorescence imaging (FLI)-and enabling high-sensitivity detection of circulating tumor cells and tumor-derived exosomes, among various liquid biopsy biomarkers. In therapy, nanoscale carriers (e.g., liposomes, polymeric micelles) improve tumor targeting and accumulation efficiency through passive and active targeting strategies, thereby augmenting anticancer efficacy while effectively reducing systemic toxicity. Furthermore, nanotechnology has spurred the rapid advancement of emerging modalities, including photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and immunotherapy. Notably, the construction of theranostic platforms that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic units within a single nanosystem enables in vivo, real-time visualization of drug delivery, treatment monitoring, and therapeutic response feedback, providing a powerful toolkit for advancing breast cancer toward personalized, precision medicine.

41470842,How the Intake of Pulses May Impact Metabolic Disorders and Dementia Risk: A Narrative Review.,"We present a narrative review focusing on pulses' geographical origin and distribution, their impact on human evolution and history, and their influence on human health. Pulses, including dry peas, beans, and lentils, are renowned for their richness in chemical antioxidants. Despite containing antinutrients, processing techniques preserve their health advantages. Epidemiological research has consistently demonstrated that the consumption of pulses is associated with favorable effects on metabolism. This evidence is further supported by molecular and clinical research, which has elucidated potential nutrigenomic mechanisms and effects on gut microbiota composition underlying their health benefits. However, the literature lacks randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the effects of pulses on health outcomes. Despite this limitation, our review provides valuable insights into the potential beneficial effects of pulses in ameliorating metabolic disorders and reducing the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Acknowledging the current limitations, we identify areas for further research to generate additional evidence. Specifically, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to thoroughly assess the efficacy of pulses in preventing metabolic diseases. Addressing these research gaps will enhance our understanding of the health benefits associated with pulse consumption and facilitate evidence-based dietary recommendations to improve public health outcomes.",2025,Nutrients,L1_scientific_engagement
41470839,Controversies and Perspectives of Time-Qualified Dietary Interventions.,"Time-qualified dietary interventions, including time-restricted eating (TRE), intermittent fasting (IF), and periodic fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs), have emerged as strategies to improve metabolic health. While preclinical studies consistently demonstrate robust effects on energy metabolism, cardiometabolic function, and longevity, translation to humans remains heterogeneous. In free-living settings, most metabolic improvements observed with TRE and IF appear primarily driven by spontaneous caloric restriction rather than meal timing per se, and isocaloric randomized controlled trials generally show no additional benefits compared to standard calorie restriction. Evidence supporting circadian-specific advantages, particularly for early TRE, is promising but inconsistent and often context-dependent. Important uncertainties also persist regarding long-term efficacy, lean mass preservation, safety in specific populations, and the physiological impact of extended fasting windows. Despite these controversies, time-qualified diets represent a paradigm shift in nutritional science by integrating chronobiology with dietary patterns. Future directions include tailoring eating windows to individual chronotypes, combining fasting regimens with high-quality dietary patterns and structured physical activity, and clarifying the molecular mechanisms that may mediate calorie-independent benefits. Large, long-term, mechanistically informed human trials are essential to determine whether aligning eating behaviors with circadian biology can produce durable clinical improvements.

41470798,"Ultra-Processed Foods and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Narrative Review of Epidemiology, Mechanisms, and Dietary Implications.","Ultra-processed foods (UPFs), industrial formulations rich in refined substrates and additives, have been increasingly examined as plausible contributors to gut dysbiosis and mucosal inflammation relevant to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This narrative review synthesizes epidemiological, mechanistic, and interventional evidence on UPF intake and IBD based on a structured literature search from 2010 to 2025. Large-scale prospective cohorts consistently associate higher UPF intake with increased risk of Crohn's disease (CD), whereas findings for ulcerative colitis (UC) remain weaker or inconsistent. Among individuals with established IBD, observational data suggest that greater UPF consumption correlates with higher disease activity and relapse, although potential confounding and reverse causation must be considered. Preclinical studies demonstrate that specific UPF constituents-including emulsifiers, carrageenan, maltodextrin, microparticles, and excess dietary salt-can disrupt epithelial barrier integrity, alter the gut microbiota, and activate immune pathways, providing biological plausibility while underscoring translational gaps. Interventional evidence, particularly for exclusive enteral nutrition and the Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet, suggests clinical benefit from reducing UPFs or selected additives, mainly in CD, though data in adults and UC remain limited. Overall, current evidence indicates that dietary strategies to limit UPF exposure may represent a promising and modifiable component of IBD management.

41470783,Research Advances in the Impact of Probiotic Supplementation on Ulcerative Colitis Management.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, non-specific inflammatory bowel disease with an unknown etiology. The primary symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and mucopurulent bloody stools, which manifest in recurrent episodes and often resist therapeutic interventions. Recent research has increasingly emphasized the potential role of probiotics in the management of UC, revealing a significant dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota of affected individuals. Probiotic supplementation has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating UC symptoms through various mechanisms. Probiotics contribute to the restoration of the intestinal microecosystem balance by promoting beneficial bacteria and inhibiting pathogenic strains. They also play a role in modulating the immune response, thereby reducing inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines, which collectively help mitigate intestinal inflammation. Furthermore, certain probiotics have been shown to improve intestinal barrier function, preventing the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms and enhancing intestinal permeability. Although numerous animal studies and clinical trials have validated the positive effects of probiotics on UC, the degree of efficacy varies among different strains.

41470166,Navigating the Therapeutic Pathway and Optimal First-Line Systemic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a prevalent form of cancer with a poor prognosis and requires systemic therapies for most advanced cases. In this review, we summarize considerations for selecting treatment options for HCC, particularly with regard to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Traditional chemotherapy has been surpassed by molecular-targeted therapies and ICIs, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, which enhance the immune response against tumors. The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines recommend atezolizumab/bevacizumab (Atez/Bev) and tremelimumab/durvalumab (Dur/Tre) as first-line treatments for unresectable HCC, along with alternatives, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib. Atezolizumab and bevacizumab have demonstrated superior efficacy but require the monitoring of bleeding risk and adverse events, such as proteinuria. Tremelimumab and durvalumab offer alternatives for patients at high risk of anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (anti-VEGF)-related complications. In cases where ICIs are contraindicated, lenvatinib and sorafenib serve as additional options, with lenvatinib demonstrating longer progression free survival (PFS) in clinical trials. It is important to consider that each treatment has specific side effects or contraindications, and the choice of medication should be based not only on the therapeutic efficacy of the drug, but also on the patient's health status, liver function, and tumor characteristics.",2025,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",L1_scientific_engagement
41470115,Mechanistic Insights and Advances of Bispecific T Cell Engaging Antibodies Therapy in Multiple Myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells characterized by bone marrow infiltration and excessive production of monoclonal immunoglobulins, leading to end-organ damage such as osteolytic bone lesions. Despite substantial therapeutic progress achieved with proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies, multiple myeloma remains incurable, and outcomes for triple-class-refractory patients remain dismal, with median survival below one year. Bispecific T cell engaging antibodies (TCEs) have recently emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic approach capable of redirecting cytotoxic T cells to eliminate malignant plasma cells. These engineered antibodies simultaneously engage CD3 on T cells and a tumor-associated antigen such as B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), G protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), or Fc receptor homolog 5 (FcRH5), thereby forming an immune synapse that triggers T cell activation, cytokine secretion, and perforin-granzyme-mediated apoptosis of the targeted B cell. This review summarizes the molecular design, mechanism of action, and clinical development of TCEs in MM, encompassing early bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTE) constructs such as AMG 420 and next-generation IgG-like molecules including teclistamab. Pivotal clinical trials have demonstrated overall response rates between 43% and 73%, accompanied by durable remissions and manageable safety profiles. Future directions include earlier-line integration, synergistic combinations with immunomodulatory or costimulatory agents, and the development of trispecific formats to overcome antigen escape and T cell exhaustion. Collectively, TCEs represent a paradigm shift toward durable, immune-mediated disease control in multiple myeloma.",2025,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",L1_scientific_engagement
41470114,Proteoglycans in Prostate Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance.,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex noncellular network of (macro-)molecules that surrounds and supports diverse cells in tissues and organs. In cancer, ECM is a part of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that embeds its cellular components including cancer cells and the neighboring non-cancerous stromal cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells. Given the complexity of players and interactions that the ECM participates in and is exposed to in the TME, it does not come as a surprise that many of the processes that drive cancer progression take part precisely in the ECM compartment of the TME. Along with diverse glycoproteins and collagens, proteoglycans (PGs) are among the main components of the core ECM. PGs are composed of a protein core to which glycosaminoglycan chains are attached. Considering the structural diversity of these molecules and their 'hybrid' nature, it is not surprising that they are involved in a variety of processes that are vital for surrounding cells. Moreover, they are secreted by both cancer and stromal cells, contributing to the complexity of interactions in the TME. In prostate cancer, PGs have been shown to be involved in many steps of its progression; the most prominent examples include the seemingly tumor-promoting roles of versican, perlecan, and biglycan, and the tumor-suppressive roles of decorin and betaglycan. The role of syndecan 1 is a bit more complex; namely, the nature of its role is context dependent. In this narrative review article, the roles of PGs in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance are discussed in more detail.",2025,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",L1_scientific_engagement
41470000,CAR T cells as novel therapeutic strategy for multiple sclerosis and other neuroimmune disorders.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is rapidly emerging as a transformative approach for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neuroimmune disorders such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), and myasthenia gravis (MG), alongside several other rare neuroimmunological conditions currently being evaluated in compassionate-use or early-phase studies. These conditions are driven in part by autoreactive B cells that sustain chronic inflammation and progressive tissue damage. While current immunomodulatory therapies have improved clinical outcomes, they often require lifelong administration and fail to effectively eliminate compartmentalized inflammation within the central nervous system. Recent advances in CD19- and BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy, initially developed for hematologic malignancies, demonstrate the potential to achieve targeted, durable B-cell depletion and immune reprogramming in autoimmune diseases. Preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials have shown promising efficacy, including reduced relapse rates, stabilization of disability progression, and decreased autoantibody levels, alongside a favorable safety profile with lower rates of high-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) compared to oncologic applications. This review synthesizes the current evidence supporting the use of CAR T-cell therapy in neuroinflammatory diseases and explores its potential to redefine treatment paradigms by shifting from chronic immunosuppression to long-term immune tolerance, creating a favorable environment for repair mechanisms. Realizing the full therapeutic promise of CAR T-cells in autoimmune neurology will require sustained research in heterogeneous populations and across disease spectrums.",2025,Journal of neuroinflammation,L1_scientific_engagement
41469945,The impact of new tetralogy drugs on ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Heart failure, particularly heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), represents a major global health challenge due to its high prevalence, rapid progression, and substantial mortality rates. While the “New Tetralogy” drugs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) have significantly advanced HFrEF management, their comparative effects on ventricular remodeling remain unclear. This network meta-analysis systematically evaluates these therapeutic agents to inform optimal clinical decision-making. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating ventricular remodeling parameters in HFrEF patients. Twenty-two RCTs involving 16,425 participants were included. Data were analyzed using Stata 14.2 and RevMan 5.3, with outcomes expressed as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our study showed markedly different therapeutic characteristics: sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors significantly reduced left ventricular mass index (MD = -6.57, 95% CI: -11.98 to -1.16), while beta-blockers demonstrated superior improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction compared to mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MD = 3.54, 95% CI: 0.60 to 6.48) through indirect comparison. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists showed greater efficacy in reducing left ventricular end-systolic volume (MD = -22.10, 95% CI: -31.42 to -12.78). Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors outperformed renin-angiotensin system inhibitors across multiple parameters, including left ventricular end-systolic volume (MD = -7.00, 95% CI: -13.91 to -0.09), end-systolic volume index (MD = -13.78, 95% CI: -25.98 to -1.58), and end-diastolic volume index (MD = -5.80, 95% CI: -9.76 to -1.84). This network meta-analysis demonstrates that each component of the “New Tetralogy” applies unique beneficial effects on ventricular remodeling. Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists predominantly improve ventricular volumes, while beta-blockers significantly enhance systolic function. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for personalized therapeutic strategies in HFrEF management, particularly for patients with persistent left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

41469927,"Mechanisms, efficacy, and future perspectives of cellular-based therapies for liver fibrosis/cirrhosis: focusing on mesenchymal stromal cells.","Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and formation of fibrous scars, arises from chronic liver injury and poses a significant global health burden. Although liver transplantation remains the sole curative option, its application is limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection risks, and high costs. Cellular therapies, particularly those based on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), have emerged as a promising alternative. This review comprehensively examines the therapeutic mechanisms and clinical efficacy of diverse cell therapies for liver cirrhosis, with a focus on MSC-based approaches. MSCs demonstrate multifaceted advantages, including immunomodulatory properties, anti-fibrotic effects (via hepatic stellate cell inhibition and ECM remodeling), promotion of hepatocyte regeneration, and mitigation of oxidative stress. Their low immunogenicity facilitates allogeneic transplantation, while their availability from multiple sources (e.g., bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue) supports scalable clinical application. We analyze 95 registered clinical trials (73 MSC-focused), highlighting consistent safety profiles but variable efficacy, influenced by factors such as cell source, preparation protocols, administration route, and patient heterogeneity. Key challenges include standardizing MSC production (donor selection, culture conditions, cryopreservation), optimizing delivery methods (intravenous vs. intrahepatic routes), and defining dosing regimens. Strategies to enhance MSC efficacy-such as genetic modification, biomaterial engineering, combinatorial therapies (e.g., with endothelial progenitor cells or macrophages), and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles-are critically evaluated. Future perspectives emphasize the need for large-scale randomized trials, single-cell technologies to resolve MSC heterogeneity, and organoid models to refine therapeutic protocols.",2025,Cell & bioscience,L1_scientific_engagement

41469916,Stem cell therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction: a systematic review of clinical trials.,"Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential regenerative approach for Acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Despite decades of research and advancement in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) management, translating innovative therapies from bench to bedside remains a central challenge. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes exhibit considerable variability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical landscape of stem cell therapy for AMI, specifically focusing on how variations in cell type, delivery timing, routes, and dosages can affect cell therapy efficacy. This study is a systematic review of randomized clinical trials. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. After searching the relevant databases, a total of 5276 studies were assessed, and 43 trials were considered eligible for inclusion in the present systematic review. The safety and efficacy of various types of stem cells, including bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), cardiac progenitor cells, and, more recently, induced pluripotent stem cells, have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and meta-analyses. Among these, BM-MNCs and MSCs have been the most extensively studied. Although results vary from trial to trial and can even be contradictory, from frank failures to monumental achievements, overall, the evidence supports modest but statistically significant improvements in surrogate endpoints, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), ventricular remodeling, and reduced infarct size. We have critically reviewed how methodological approaches-especially the definitions of endpoints and clinical outcome measures-have significantly influenced the reported efficacy and direction of the field. The interpretation of clinical trial results in cell therapy for AMI is heavily impacted by the specific metrics used to define success. A key focus is distinguishing between clinical trials on patients with acute and recent myocardial infarction (which is the main focus of this review) and those with chronic ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, as they involve different treatment strategies. Patient selection is essential for improving responses in patients with AMI. Those with a severely reduced LVEF (LVEF < 40%) and younger age tend to benefit more. Limiting the transplantation window to the first 3-7 days after AMI may improve the intervention's effectiveness.",2025,Stem cell research & therapy,L1_scientific_engagement
41469852,Comparative effectiveness and safety of preventive treatments for vestibular migraine: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Vestibular migraine causes recurrent vertigo attacks that significantly impact quality of life. While various preventive medications are used, their comparative effectiveness was unknown. Previous systematic reviews have been limited by pairwise comparisons only or exclusion of newer treatments. The lack of head-to-head trials comparing all available treatments further complicates evidence-based decision-making. This evidence gap has real-world consequences, has also substantial economic burden of Vestibular migraine. There is a need for direct comparison studies between the most promising treatments to provide clearer guidance for clinical practice. To determine the comparative effectiveness and safety of preventive treatments for vestibular migraine through systematic review and network meta-analysis. Given the lack of head-to-head randomized trials, a network meta-analysis (NMA) provides the most appropriate method to compare available treatments by combining both direct and indirect evidence. We searched Embase, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane Library from inception to January 15, 2025. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective observational studies (n ≥ 30 for CGRP antagonists) comparing preventive treatments for vestibular migraine diagnosed according to either Bárány Society/International Headache Society criteria (post-2012) or Neuhauser criteria (pre-2012). Primary outcomes were monthly vertigo frequency and quality of life (DHI scores). We conducted frequentist network meta-analysis and assessed certainty using GRADE. From 340 identified records, nine studies met inclusion criteria. Five RCTs (419 patients) comparing seven treatments were included in the network meta-analysis. All treatments significantly reduced monthly vertigo attacks versus control. Propranolol ranked highest (P-score: 0.794; -7.04 attacks/month, 95% CI -12.77 to -1.31), followed by valproic acid (-5.95, 95% CI -9.01 to -2.89) and venlafaxine (-5.94, 95% CI -8.98 to -2.90). Galcanezumab showed moderate efficacy (-5.80, 95% CI -10.61 to -0.99) with zero discontinuations. Network heterogeneity was negligible (τ²<0.001). Evidence certainty was moderate for galcanezumab and low to very low for other treatments. All evaluated treatments effectively reduce vertigo frequency in vestibular migraine. While propranolol showed the largest effect, this relied on indirect evidence. Galcanezumab offers the best balance of efficacy, tolerability, and evidence quality.

41469674,Long-term efficacy of an optimized online gambling self-exclusion procedure with extended suspension of commercial solicitations: a randomized controlled trial.,"Most individuals self-excluding from gambling have lost control over their gambling behavior. Commercial solicitations are prohibited during the self-exclusion period, but resume immediately afterwards. The self-exclusion system appears insufficient, particularly for short self-exclusions and among the heaviest gamblers. We assessed the impact of extending suspension of commercial solicitations on gambling intensity. In this parallel randomized study, we included 2548 French online gamblers who self-excluded for up to 3 months from May-November 2022. They were assigned 1:1 to optimized self-exclusion with extended commercial solicitations ban for 9 months or standard procedure. The primary outcome was the change in total loss over the past 4 weeks at Month 9. We also assessed total deposit, total stakes, compulsivity, number and duration of gaming sessions and subsequent self-exclusions at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months. Participants were randomized to the optimized group (n = 1265) or standard group (n = 1283). The results didn't show a significant difference in the reduction in total losses. The optimized group showed significantly reduced 4-week total deposits versus standard group at 6 months (455.68 euros vs. 319.65 euros, p = 0.017), 9 months (451.92 euros vs. 343.21 euros, p = 0.040), and 12 months (484.27 euros vs. 370.02 euros, p = 0.025). Significance was lost at 18 months (492.61 euros vs. 404.73 euros, p = 0.087). An extended 9-month ban on direct commercial solicitations after self-exclusion significantly reduces gambling deposits during, and 3 months after, the ban. This supports the effectiveness of improving self-exclusion procedure. Future research should explore longer bans and indirect commercial solicitations.

Increasing evidence highlights the gut microbiota as a pivotal regulator of antitumor immunity, modulating T cell activation, macrophage polarization, and dendritic cell function. Microbial communities and their metabolites can either inhibit or enhance immune surveillance, thereby influencing the efficacy of immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and CAR-T cell therapy. Approaches including dietary modulation, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and microbial metabolite supplementation show promise in restoring immune homeostasis and improving treatment outcomes. Additionally, gut microbiome profiling has emerged as a potential source of biomarkers for predicting therapeutic response and immune-related adverse events.

Long-term sickness is the most common reason for economic inactivity. In the North of England, economic activity is lower, and levels of poor health in the working age population are higher, than national averages. The international literature reports many interventions designed to reduce economic inactivity including those designed to ameliorate the impact of health conditions on work participation, however, there is a need for high-quality evidence of what works for people with health conditions living in the United Kingdom (UK), and in particular for those living in areas of high deprivation such as the North of England. We conducted a systematic review preregistered with the open science framework. We searched AMED, ASSIA, Business Source Premier, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, PsycARTICLES, Science Direct, and Scopus to November 2023. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies consisted of experimental and observational studies published or in grey literature that examined the efficacy or effectiveness of interventions in reducing economic inactivity in people with health conditions living in the UK. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts followed by data extraction and synthesis using the Narrative Synthesis Framework. Twenty-seven reports detailing sixteen unique studies and eight different interventions met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There was conflicting evidence for the effectiveness of sanctions on economic inactivity and the most robust evidence for classic individual placement and support although more evidence is needed for time-limited individual placement and support. Included studies highlighted the importance of providing specialist employment advice via skilled and experienced advisors but conflicting evidence on combining employment advice with specific psychological therapies. Overall, we found limited robust evidence of what works in reducing health related economic inactivity, particularly for populations experiencing elevated levels of socio-economic deprivation.

This abstract explores the profound impact of nanotechnology on wound care, highlighting the unique properties of nanomaterials and their role in advancing therapeutic interventions. Nanomaterials, characterized by their dimensions at the nanoscale, have emerged as versatile tools in wound management. The review focuses on various types of nanomaterials, including nanoparticles, nanofibers, and nanocomposites, which offer tailored solutions for optimizing wound healing processes to facilitate controlled drug delivery, developing a novel approach on account of achieving controlled transport of bioactive agents, such as growth factors, antimicrobial compounds, and anti-inflammatory drugs. This precision in drug delivery enhances therapeutic efficacy, promoting optimal wound healing outcomes. One of the pivotal contributions of nanomaterials to wound management is their engineered antimicrobial properties. Nanoparticles also exhibit effective antibacterial characteristics, addressing concerns related to wound infections. Nanomaterials integrated into dressings and scaffolds enhance mechanical strength and provide a conducive environment for cellular processes, fostering tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix synthesis.

41469338,MUTATIONAL STATUS AND TREATMENT EFFICACY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA.,"The use of targeted therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) - tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) - has led to significant success in the treatment of patients with CML. The life expectancy of patients with newly diagnosed CML is almost equal to that of the general population. A significant proportion of patients on TKI therapy achieve stable and long'term remission, and after two or more years, it is possible to safely discontinue therapy. The increase in patient life expectancy has contributed to an increased risk of developing resistance to therapy, which is largely associated with mutations in the kinase domain of the BCR::ABL1gene, which are of decisive clinical importance.The objectiveof this article is to evaluate the role of the mutation status of the kinase domain of the BCR::ABL1gene and other somatic mutations in patients with CML in the development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the impact of mutations on treatment efficacy based on literature data. The study used publications from 2015-2025, selected from the PubMed and Scopus databases and specialized scientific journals using the keywords (chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR::ABL1, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), T315Imutation, TKI resistance, mutation status, imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib, asciminib). After reviewing the full texts of the articles, those that directly addressed the mutation status in CML, as well as some general aspects of CML (pathogenesis, clinical course, diagnosis, treatment), were selected for further analysis. The analysis demonstrated a high prevalence of clinically significant mutations, particularly T315I, which cause resistance to TKIs. The available data indicate that third' and fourth'generation TKIs, in particular ponatinib, as well as the new allosteric inhibitor asciminib, have significant potential in the treatment of patients with resistant forms of CML, including carriers of the T315Imutation. There are cases of compound mutations that remain a serious therapeutic challenge. To effectively combat resistant clones, it is necessary to determine the mutation status and select therapy according to the sensitivity of the clone. A personalized approach that takes into account the BCR::ABL1mutation profile is key to optimizing therapeutic strategies for CML. Further research is needed to more clearly define the mechanisms of resistance and the optimal sequence of use of available TKIs in clinical practice. Актуальність: застосування таргетної терапії хронічної мієлоїдної лейкемії (ХМЛ) – інгібіторів тирозинкінази(ІТК) – дозволило досягти значного успіху в лікуванні пацієнтів з ХМЛ. Тривалість життя пацієнтів із вперше діагностованою ХМЛ майже відповідає популяційним показникам. Значна частка пацієнтів на терапії ІТК досягають стабільної і тривалої ремісії та через два і більше років можливе безпечне припинення терапії. Збільшення тривалості життя пацієнтів сприяло підвищенню ризику формування резистентності до терапії, що значноюмірою пов’язано з мутаціями в кіназному домені гена BCR::ABL1, які мають визначальне клінічне значення.Метоюданої статті є оцінка ролі мутаційного статусу кіназного домену гена BCR::ABL1та інших соматичних мутацій у пацієнтів з ХМЛ у розвитку резистентності до інгібіторів тирозинкінази та вплив мутацій на ефективністьлікування за даними літератури.Джерела даних.

41469222,To CB2 or not CB2: Revisiting renoprotection in acute and chronic kidney injury.,"The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), which is encoded by the Cnr2 gene, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that controls immune responses and has recently emerged as a regulator of renal injury and repair. Over the past 15 years, numerous pharmacological and genetics studies have explored the role of CB2 in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although the precise localisation of CB2 within renal compartments remains under debate, pharmacologically mediated CB2 agonism, across a wide array of chemical, metabolic, ischaemia and obstructive mouse models, has consistently preserved tubular epithelial cell integrity, reduced inflammation, and limited tubulointerstitial fibrosis. These protective effects of CB2 activation are further supported by the opposing outcomes in Cnr2 knockout mice, which showed worsened injury. More selective CB2 ligands with defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in preclinical animal models along with late-stage clinical studies have further substantiated the safety and efficacy of this type of therapeutic approach. Nevertheless, a few studies have reported conflicting results, suggesting a CB2-dependent contribution towards tubular damage, although these findings are complicated by differences in ligand selectivity, possible off-target activity, and experimental design. With this in mind, the prevailing evidence supports CB2 activation as beneficial in both AKI and CKD and warrants continued translational progress to develop CB2 agonists for therapeutic applications in kidney disease.",2025,British journal of pharmacology,L1_scientific_engagement

Studies were required to report efficacy outcomes (such as upper extremity motor function and swallowing function) as well as safety outcomes. Two researchers independently performed literature screening, data extraction and quality assessment. A meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan V.5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, United Kingdom) and STATA V.18.0(StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA), using the standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes and applying a random-effects model. To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed, while publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Overall, 18 RCTs involving 954 participants were included in this study. This meta-analysis indicated that VNS could improve Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (SMD=0.89, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20, The evidence supporting the use of VNS to improve function in stroke patients demonstrates reasonable reliability, a satisfactory degree of consistency and applicability, and suggests a potentially favourable clinical impact.",2025,BMJ open,L1_scientific_engagement
41469030,Direct oral anticoagulants combined with antiplatelet in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or complicating acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) combined with antiplatelet therapy (APT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients and those with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or complicating ACS. Data were pooled using the Mantel - Haenszel random-effect models. The risk ratio (RR) value and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated were applied to dichotomous outcomes. In 38,170 ACS patients from 11 studies, DOACs combined with APT significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), stent thrombosis (ST), ischemic stroke and all-cause death, accompanied by increased bleeding risks compared with control groups. Among 11,175 participants from 6 studies involving AF patients undergoing PCI or complicating ACS, DOACs plus APT markedly reduced bleeding risksin various definitions, with no significant difference in efficacy outcomes compared with control groups. The combination of DOACs and APT requires a tailored approach. For ACS patients, therapy should center on balancing ischemic and bleeding risks, favoring those at high ischemic risk but low or manageable bleeding risk. In contrast, for AF patients undergoing PCI or complicating ACS, the regimen is aimed at risk minimization and is most suitable for patients in whom this is the primary concern.Protocol registration: .uk/prospero identifier is CRD42025645639.http://www.crd.york.ac.",2025,Expert opinion on drug safety,L1_scientific_engagement
41468986,"Cardiac Rehabilitation for Coronary Artery Disease: Gaps, Digital Models, and the Future of Personalized Prevention.","Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, with coronary artery disease representing the primary driver of premature death. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a cornerstone of secondary prevention that integrates exercise, risk factor modification, and education. CR reduces all-cause mortality, recurrent ischemic events, and improves quality of life. Yet, participation remains suboptimal, and CR is underutilized by women, older adults, minorities, and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. We examine the modalities of CR including traditional center-based CR (CBCR), home-based CR and hybrid models. By leveraging telemedicine, mobile health, and wearable biosensors remote delivery of CR has shown comparable efficacy to traditional CBCR. The integration of artificial intelligence offers opportunities to personalize CR through continuous physiological monitoring and exercise prescriptions. In conclusion, CR remains cost-effective from a health-system perspective, but patient-level affordability and equitable access require targeted policy, financial, and culturally adapted interventions to ensure personalized and equitable delivery of secondary prevention.",2025,The American journal of cardiology,L1_scientific_engagement

Microrobot technology has brought revolutionary advancements to the field of tumor medicine. By leveraging its micro/nanoscale dimensions and precise propulsion and navigation capabilities, it has enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a detailed exploration of microrobots' motion from the perspectives of propulsion and navigation. It systematically summarizes its key applications in cancer therapy. Microrobots, which utilize gas, magnetic, light, or ultrasound-based propulsion mechanisms, and are combined with asymmetrical morphologies or biotargeted navigation, can traverse complex biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier and mucus barrier. They enable precise delivery and controlled release of anticancer drugs. In the realm of diagnosis and imaging, microrobots, by carrying fluorescent probes or contrast agents, have improved the sensitivity of tumor detection and the resolution of deep tissue imaging. Furthermore, microrobots, when coordinated with photothermal therapy, sonodynamic therapy, or immunotherapy, have enhanced tumor eradication effects. They also activate immune responses to inhibit metastatic lesions. Finally, this review provides an outlook on the prospects of microrobots in tumor medicine, proposing potential collaborative pathways with emerging technologies.

41468784,Neuropeptide Y at the crossroads of neurodegeneration: Mechanistic insights and emerging therapeutic strategies.,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a widely distributed and highly conserved neuropeptide, plays a central role in the regulation of diverse physiological processes, including stress responses, energy homeostasis, vascular tone, and immune modulation, via activation of its receptor subtypes. Beyond its physiological roles, the dysregulation of NPY expression has been documented in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Machado-Joseph disease, and retinal disorders such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. These alterations in NPY levels and receptor activity highlight its potential not only as a biomarker for disease progression but also as a promising therapeutic target. Previous evidence revealed that NPY exerts neuroprotection by alleviating excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation while concurrently facilitating neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cellular resilience. NPY activates receptor-mediated intracellular signaling cascades like PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and p38K, that control cellular survival, proteostasis, and inflammation and thereby influence disease trajectories. Understanding NPY operation with these mechanisms can unveil new avenues for targeted therapy. Current insights into the complex roles of NPY in neurodegeneration are discussed in this review, and their implications in diagnostic and treatment strategies are addressed.",2025,Neuropeptides,L1_scientific_engagement
41468777,The potential use of anti-codon engineered tRNAs (ACE-tRNAs) to treat nonsense variants causing inherited retinal diseases.,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are clinically and genetically complex disorders that cause blindness in about one in 3450 individuals worldwide. More than 350 genes have been implicated in IRDs showing all possible inheritance patterns. Despite the advancement of several genetic therapies, there is currently no cure for the vast majority of IRDs. By converting a sense codon into a nonsense codon, premature termination codon (PTC) variants cause abrupt termination of protein synthesis, leading to loss of protein function in most cases. Nonsense variants account for approximately 18 % of all disease-causing variants in IRDs, and there is currently no effective treatment available to correct them. In recent years, anticodon engineered tRNAs (ACE-tRNAs) or suppressor tRNAs have emerged as potential therapeutic option for treating rare diseases caused by nonsense variants. This review critically summarizes the spectrum of nonsense variants in the genetics of IRDs and examines the promise of ACE-tRNA therapy as a treatment. We focus on the therapy's mechanism of action, current advancements, and its specific advantages and limitations for addressing nonsense variant-induced IRDs.",2025,Molecular aspects of medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41468772,The current role of cryoablation in the management of soft tissue and bone tumors: A narrative review.,"Cryoablation (CA) is an image-guided, minimally invasive technique that is gaining traction in the treatment of both benign and malignant soft tissue and bone tumors. This narrative review presents the current evidence supporting its clinical applications in both curative and palliative settings. In malignant tumors-including soft tissue sarcomas and bone metastases-cryoablation provides effective local control, particularly in cases of recurrence, inoperability, or metastatic disease, and enables chemotherapy-free intervals, contributing to improved quality of life. In benign lesions, such as desmoid fibromatosis, cryoablation offers significant symptomatic relief and substantial tumor volume reduction with a low complication profile. CA demonstrates high local tumor control rates, especially in patients with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic lesions and offers significant advantages over conventional treatments in terms of safety, anesthesia requirements, pain control, and hospitalization duration. Technological innovations, including robotic assistance and advanced navigation systems, have enhanced CA's precision and feasibility in anatomically challenging regions. Although current evidence supports its role as an alternative or adjunctive therapy in selected patients, prospective, randomized studies are still needed to define optimal patient selection, long-term outcomes, and standardized protocols. METHODS: This narrative review was conducted to evaluate the current role of cryoablation (CA) in the treatment of soft tissue and bone tumors. A targeted literature search was performed in PubMed and Scopus databases up to August 2025, using keywords including cryoablation, soft tissue tumors, bone tumors, and image-guided ablation. Relevant clinical studies, reviews, and retrospective series were included. Priority was given to publications reporting therapeutic outcomes and safety data.

41468711,AI-powered intestinal ultrasound in inflammatory bowel disease: Advancing toward automated disease assessment.,"The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) relies on accurate disease assessment and close monitoring to guide therapy and evaluate treatment response. While endoscopy remains the gold standard for detecting mucosal inflammation, its invasiveness and inability to fully assess transmural disease or extraintestinal complications limit its use as a stand-alone tool. Cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI, provide accurate evaluations but are hindered by high cost, limited accessibility, and patient burden. Therefore, intestinal ultrasound (IUS) has emerged as a safe, non-invasive, and reproducible modality to evaluate transmural inflammation and complications in real time, making it increasingly relevant for both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, challenges such as operator dependence, variability in image acquisition, and lack of standardize protocols have limited its widespread adoption. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential to overcome these barriers by automating image analysis, standardising interpretation, and reducing interobserver variability. Early applications have shown promise in bowel wall segmentation and thickness assessment, with future opportunities to further integrate imaging features with biomarkers, clinical data, and multi-omics for precision medicine. This review aims to explore the current and future roles of IUS, summarizing the potential of AI in IUS to improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance disease monitoring, and enable personalized patient management. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of existing approaches, highlight barriers to clinical implementation, and outline perspectives on how AI-enhanced IUS may transform both research and routine care in IBD.",2025,Current opinion in pharmacology,L1_scientific_engagement
41468703,Purinergic signaling and energetic metabolism in bipolar disorder: From pathophysiology to precision therapeutics.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric illness marked by recurrent manic and depressive episodes, with substantial disability and high comorbidity. Emerging evidence highlights purinergic signaling and cellular energy metabolism as convergent, interdependent drivers of BD pathophysiology. Purines-particularly adenosine and ATP-function dually as intracellular energy substrates and extracellular signaling molecules regulating neuroinflammation, neurotransmission, and redox balance. Dysregulation of purinergic pathways, including P2 × 7 receptor overactivation, elevated uric acid, and reduced neuroprotective adenosine, interacts with mitochondrial dysfunction-characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, ATP depletion, increased reactive oxygen species, and redox imbalance-to form a pathological feedback loop. This bioenergetic-purinergic axis underlies mood cycling: mania reflecting bioenergetic upregulation with purinergic hyperactivity, and depression representing bioenergetic downregulation with purinergic hypoactivity. Biomarkers such as uric acid, xanthine dehydrogenase and adenosine deaminase activity, phosphocreatine, ATP levels, and oxidative stress indices demonstrate phase-dependent alterations and hold promise for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Therapeutic opportunities extend beyond conventional mood stabilizers to include xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol), P2 × 7 antagonists, adenosine modulators, and mitochondrial-supportive agents (e.g., creatine, carnitine, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine). Integration of omics profiling, advanced neuroimaging, and biomarker-guided stratification may enable precision psychiatry approaches tailored to individual metabolic-inflammatory phenotypes. This integrative model reframes BD as a systemic disorder of cellular energetics and purinergic signaling, offering novel mechanistic targets and guiding the development of personalized, phase-specific interventions to improve long-term outcomes.",2025,Psychiatry research,L1_scientific_engagement
41468643,Extracellular vesicles in tumor microenvironment modulation and clinical diagnosis.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key drivers of tumor metastasis and colonization. Their cargo, consisting of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules, functions as molecular messengers that trigger the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in tumor cells and facilitate immune evasion by releasing immunosuppressive factors to promote immune escape. Additionally, EVs influence intercellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment, facilitating angiogenesis, increasing vascular permeability, and supplying nutrients and oxygen to support tumor growth and metastasis. During metastasis, EVs protect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from shear forces in the vascular network and attacks from the immune system. Furthermore, tumor-derived EVs facilitate the establishment of pre-metastatic niches (PMNs), thereby facilitating organ-specific metastasis. In this review, we overview the biogenesis and functions of EVs, as well as various factors that regulate their secretion. We systematically review tumor-derived EV functions in tumor progression, and also the effects of their interactions with other cells (such as adipocytes, immune cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells) in the tumor microenvironment was clarified. Additionally, we evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of EVs as biomarkers for early tumor detection. The review also summarizes validated EV-associated biomarkers, offering a valuable foundation for the development of EV-based strategies in cancer diagnosis and therapy.",2025,"Pathology, research and practice",L1_scientific_engagement

41468579,"MyPainPal, a Novel mHealth App to Improve Pain in Patients With Advanced Cancer: Single-Arm Pilot Study.","Pain is common among patients with advanced cancer and is often inadequately controlled. Opioids are central to treatment; yet, self-management is challenging, and clinicians lack scalable tools to monitor and support patients between visits. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of MyPainPal (Dana-Faber Cancer Institute), a novel mobile health app designed to optimize cancer pain management. MyPainPal combines daily surveys assessing symptoms and analgesic use, algorithmic self-management support, tailored psychoeducation, and clinician monitoring. Secondary objectives were to explore preliminary clinical impact and identify priorities for refinement. This single-arm pilot study enrolled adults with advanced malignancies using opioids for moderate-to-severe pain from an outpatient palliative care clinic at a comprehensive cancer center. Participants used MyPainPal for 28 days while nurses monitored symptom responses via a secure portal, and also completed structured surveys at end-of-study. Primary assessment of usability and acceptability included the System Usability Scale (SUS; range 0-100), the Acceptability E-Scale (range 6-30), and ratings of satisfaction using a 5-point Likert scale. Semistructured debriefing interviews explored user experience, perceived impact, and suggestions for optimization. Twenty participants with advanced cancer enrolled, with a mean age of 57 (SD 12.3) years, 55% (11/20) female, 80% (16/20) non-Hispanic White, with mixed cancer types. Over the 28-day study, patients logged into MyPainPal a median of 14 (IQR 8-17) times, and completed a median of 8 (IQR 5-14) symptom surveys, reflecting mean of 36% (SD 20%) of eligible (out-of-hospital) days on study. Usability and acceptability ratings of MyPainPal were high (mean SUS 78.3, SD 16.2; mean Acceptability E-Scale 24.0, SD 4.4); 79% rated overall satisfaction of greater than or equal to 4/5. Twenty percent of surveys generated an alert, prompting nurse outreach. In response, 5 participants had symptom medications changed and 2 had medication errors corrected. In debriefing interviews, many participants described that the intervention reduced barriers to pain reporting and facilitated timely and constructive interactions with care teams for symptom management. Several noted that the intervention validated their pain experience, reduced stigma around opioid use, enabled constructive conversations with providers, and promoted self-management. Patients recommended several survey modifications, including reducing their frequency and enabling more nuanced pain assessments. Participants underused the educational resources and suggested that they be featured more prominently. Some patients suggested that the MyPainPal app should be introduced earlier in patients' cancer pain trajectory when pain needs are higher and opioid management is novel. In this pilot study, MyPainPal demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evidence of potential clinical impact among patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative care. The app has been rebuilt and optimized with attention to patient feedback and in preparation for a future efficacy study.

41468392,Ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block attenuates early postoperative visceral pain after laparoscopic hysterectomy: A prospective randomized controlled trial.,"Postoperative visceral pain remains a major challenge following laparoscopic hysterectomy. While stellate ganglion block (SGB) is increasingly utilized for acute and chronic pain management, limited evidence exists regarding its efficacy in modulating visceral pain after gynecologic laparoscopy. This study aimed to evaluate whether ultrasound-guided SGB could reduce early postoperative visceral pain intensity and opioid consumption. In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, 90 patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy were allocated (1:1:1) to receive ultrasound-guided SGB combined with transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB) (SGB group), TAPB alone (TAP group), or no nerve block (control group). The primary outcome was visceral pain intensity, assessed using visual analog scale (VAS) scores at rest and during movement at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included rescue analgesia requirements and complications. The linear mixed-effects model revealed that the SGB group exhibited a significantly greater reduction in visceral pain intensity at rest and during movement at 1, 3, and 6 hours compared to the TAP and control groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the percentage of patients requiring rescue analgesia was significantly lower in the SGB group compared to the TAP and control groups (14.3% vs. 32.1% and 48.1%, respectively, P < 0.05). No statistically significant differences in incisional pain were detected among the three groups at any time point (P > 0.05). Ultrasound-guided SGB effectively alleviates early postoperative visceral pain and reduces opioid demand, supporting its role as a valuable addition to multimodal analgesia protocols in laparoscopic hysterectomy.",2025,PloS one,L1_scientific_engagement
41468199,Quantitative Measurement of Rotational Knee Stability: A Systematic Review of Instrument Reliability and Validity.,"Objectively evaluating knee stability in multiple planes in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury may provide more comprehensive information than evaluating subjectively or in only a single plane. This could support both research and clinical decision making. However, for the clinical value of such an instrument to be evaluated, reliability and validity of the instrument must first be established. Despite multiple available instruments that measure rotational knee stability, it is not clear which of these instruments has adequate reliability and validity. We performed a systematic review to identify instruments for measuring rotational knee stability and to synthesize the available literature in which validity and reliability were evaluated. We searched 4 databases for publications reporting reliability or validity of an instrument designed to assess rotational knee stability. A narrative synthesis was used to present the results. We identified 42 studies evaluating 25 different instruments designed to measure movement while applying a standardized torque or while a tester performed a manual test (eg, pivot shift). There was high heterogeneity in parameters reported and criterion methods used. Intrarater and interrater reliability intraclass correlation coefficients were consistently adequate (>.75) except for when lower torques (ie, 6 N·m or less) were applied or acceleration or jerk was measured instead of laxity. Four out of 19 (21.1%) studies evaluating validity reported very good correlations (r > .8) with a criterion measure. We found no high-quality evidence that provided sufficient evidence of both reliability and validity in any device. To evaluate the clinical benefit of objectively evaluating stability in multiple planes, further work is needed to develop, refine, and evaluate this class of devices.",2025,Journal of sport rehabilitation,L1_scientific_engagement

It is now recognized that 8%-18% of children with cancer will be identified with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in a cancer predisposition gene. While progress has been significant, ongoing work is necessary to optimize the lifelong care of this growing population of individuals. This review provides an overview of the impact of 2 significant movements in the field of pediatric oncology: precision oncology trials utilizing paired tumor-germline sequencing and the development of expert-informed screening guidelines for the clinical care of children with childhood CPS. We summarize the influence these initiatives have had on patients and the clinical teams and institutions caring for them. We highlight current research that aims to elucidate the downstream effects of genetic testing and cancer surveillance for CPS to improve the efficacy of and access to CPS care as well as the psychosocial outcomes for patient and families living with a CPS. Finally, we discuss important areas of future research to better identify and care for this population across their lifespan. A broadened or universal approach to testing for childhood CPS in pediatric oncology increases opportunities for early cancer detection and treatment for children and their family members.

41468131,Considerations for Implementation of Serum Biomarker Testing for Suspected Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy.,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) complicate 8% to 9% of all pregnancies. They are a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and contribute to over $2.2 billion of health care expenditures annually. In 2023, the FDA first approved a soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio system for HDP risk stratification; however, little is known about the implementation of such biomarker testing outside of research contexts. HDP severity drives clinical management and adverse perinatal outcomes. Placental biomarker testing aims to determine which patients are at risk for developing or progressing to the most severe HDPs. Widespread implementation of biomarker testing may increase access though it may not be cost-efficient or practice-changing for individual institutions. Accordingly, further attention must be paid to restrictive testing situations (e.g., low-resource settings) or even off-label uses (e.g., multiple gestations) that may solidify the role of biomarker testing in routine practice. This review aims to outline clinical and institutional considerations for placental biomarker utilization in the context of their FDA-approved uses and to highlight the potential advantages and disadvantages of various testing strategies.",2025,Clinical chemistry,L1_scientific_engagement
41468125,Performance Characteristics of Current Biomarkers for the Prediction of Spontaneous Preterm Birth.,"Preterm birth (PTB), or birth occurring before 37 weeks' gestation, remains a significant public health burden, accounting for 10% of live births annually in the United States and incurring substantial healthcare expenditures. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) has advanced across the previous 4 decades, yet precise prediction tools and prevention strategies are lacking. Numerous studies have identified potential anatomical and molecular risk factors for sPTB, including sonographic characteristics of the cervix; maternal serum circulating RNA and proteins; maternal urine metabolic byproducts; cervicovaginal cytokine, microbiome, and metabolome composition; amniotic fluid cytokines; umbilical cord blood leukocyte DNA methylation status; and placental transcriptome profiles. This review focuses on recent developments in sPTB biomarker determination among singleton gestations. Herein, we synthesize and evaluate the test characteristics of candidate biomarkers of sPTB, concluding that no single biomarker can accurately predict sPTB. However, several individual or combined panels of biomolecules, including some commercially available, carry clinically significant predictive information. These biomarkers include cervical ultrasonography, the ratio of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 to sex-hormone binding globulin, panels of urinary metabolites and amniotic fluid proteins, and maternal circulating cell-free RNA. Future integration of select biomarkers drawn from prospective validation cohorts into existing risk stratification strategies may enhance sPTB prediction, thereby identifying patients at greatest risk.",2025,Clinical chemistry,L1_scientific_engagement
41467998,Recent Advances in the Biosensors for the Detection of Lung Cancer Biomarkers: A Review.,"Nearly 10 million deaths from cancer occurred in 2020, making it a major cause of death globally, according to the WHO and other important statistics. Given that lung cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer, it accounts for around 25% of all deaths from cancer-related causes. The two forms of lung cancer that are treated and characterized differently are small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer. To identify malignant cells, several techniques have been used in recent decades, including MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), CT (computed tomography scans), and PET (positron emission tomography). The standard detection threshold of conventional assays is insufficient for early-stage detection. As a result, numerous detection techniques have been used to identify lung cancer early. The stages of lung cancer are indicated by the amounts of these biomarkers. As a result, lung cancer screening and clinical diagnosis can be accomplished by the identification of biomarkers. EGFR, CEA, CYFRA 21-1, ENO1, NSE, CA 19-9, CA 125, and VEGF are among the many biomarkers for lung cancer. To identify lung cancer disease biomarkers, an organized summary of several biosensing platforms is given in this article. In particular, it addresses the most recent advancements in optical and electrochemical biosensors, the analytical capabilities of various biosensors, the challenges, and potential directions for future study in regular clinical analysis.

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of IL-23 inhibitors for induction and maintenance therapy in UC. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar was conducted up to May 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IL-23 inhibitors (mirikizumab, risankizumab, guselkumab) in UC. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.4) with a random-effects model. Seven RCTs (four induction, three maintenance) including 4203 patients were analyzed. IL-23 inhibitors significantly increased clinical remission during both induction (RR 1.52) and maintenance (RR 1.62). Rates of histo-endoscopic healing were also higher with IL-23 blockade in both induction (RR 2.53) and maintenance (RR 1.81). Importantly, IL-23 inhibitors were associated with a reduced risk of serious adverse events during induction (RR 0.39), with no significant difference observed during maintenance (RR 0.68). Other outcomes, including clinical response and corticosteroid-free remission, also consistently favored IL-23 blockade.

41467823,[Special features of anticoagulant treatment in vascular liver diseases].,"Anticoagulants play a major role in the management of vascular liver diseases (VLD). However, their use is challenging due to portal hypertension and thrombocytopenia, frequently observed in these conditions. Moreover, when the disease is associated with hepatic insufficiency, hemostatic abnormalities further complicate the use of anticoagulants. Finally, in cases of digestive resection following mesenteric ischemia, the absorption and pharmacokinetics of oral anticoagulant therapies raise numerous concerns. The benefit-risk balance regarding bleeding and thrombosis must therefore be carefully assessed. Nevertheless, anticoagulant therapy in VLD is crucial to prevent thrombus extension, improve recanalization, and reduce the risk of severe complications such as portal hypertension and mesenteric ischemia. It must be initiated as early as possible. Acute-phase treatment generally relies on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), switch to Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used, however, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) remain indicated in certain situations. Screening and management of esophageal varices should be systematic when initiating and managing anticoagulant therapy. Thrombocytopenia is most often moderate and should not lead to modification or discontinuation of anticoagulation. Severe thrombocytopenia < 50 G/L requires close monitoring and management in a specialized center. In Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic insufficiency may lead to reduced synthesis of coagulation factors as well as major coagulation inhibitors, allowing a degree of rebalancing of the hemostatic system. Prolonged coagulation times (aPTT) and decreased PT do not accurately reflect these changes and should not contraindicate or delay anticoagulant therapy. Women of childbearing age must be informed of the risks associated with anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Menorrhagia is common and may require appropriate management. All patients should participate in a treatment education program, enabling them to understand the characteristics and risks of their treatment. Les anticoagulants jouent un rôle majeur dans la prise en charge des maladies vasculaires du foie (MVF), leur utilisation est cependant délicate en raison de l’hypertension portale et de la thrombopénie fréquemment observées dans ces pathologies. Par ailleurs, lorsque la pathologie est associée à une insuffisance hépatique, les anomalies de l’hémostase compliquent encore leur utilisation. Enfin, en cas de résection digestive secondaire à une ischémie mésentérique, l’absorption des traitements anticoagulants oraux et leur pharmacocinétique posent de nombreuses questions. Le bénéfice/risque hémorragie/thrombose du traitement doit donc être soigneusement évalué. Le traitement anticoagulant des MVF est cependant crucial pour prévenir l’extension de la thrombose, favoriser la reperméabilisation et réduire le risque de complications graves telles que l’hypertension portale et l’ischémie mésentérique. Il doit être effectué le plus rapidement possible. Le traitement en phase aiguë repose généralement sur un traitement par héparine de bas poids moléculaire (HBPM). Les anticoagulants oraux directs (AOD) sont de plus en plus utilisés en relais. Cependant, les antivitamines K (AVK) restent indiquées dans certaines situations. Le traitement des varices œsophagiennes doit être systématique lors de l’instauration et du suivi du traitement. La thrombopénie est le plus souvent modérée et ne doit pas faire modifier ou arrêter le traitement anticoagulant. Une thrombopénie sévère inférieure à 50 G/L nécessite une surveillance étroite et une prise en charge dans un centre spécialisé. Au cours du syndrome de Budd-Chiari, l’insuffisance hépatique peut entraîner une diminution de la synthèse des facteurs de la coagulation mais également des principaux inhibiteurs de la coagulation, permettant un certain rééquilibrage de la balance hémostatique. L’allongement des temps de coagulation et la diminution du taux de prothrombine ne permettent pas d’évaluer ces modifications et ne doivent surtout pas contre-indiquer ou différer le traitement anticoagulant. Les femmes en âge de procréer doivent être informées des risques du traitement anticoagulant en cas de grossesse et au cours de l’allaitement. Les ménorragies sont fréquentes et parfois invalidantes sous traitement anticoagulant, nécessitant une prise en charge adaptée. Tous les patients doivent bénéficier d’une éducation thérapeutique leur permettant de connaître les caractéristiques, risques et bénéfices du traitement, ainsi que les précautions à prendre.",2025,La Revue du praticien,L1_scientific_engagement
41467763,Efficacy of portable EEG-based neurofeedback for ADHD: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Portable EEG-based neurofeedback (NFT) has emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, its overall efficacy remains under scrutiny, particularly in comparison to traditional interventions. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of portable EEG-based NFT in improving ADHD symptoms. A total of 10 published studies were included, involving 260 children diagnosed with ADHD in the NFT intervention groups and 131 children in control groups who did not receive NFT. The within-group analysis indicated post-treatment improvements in ADHD symptom severity for children receiving NFT. Control groups also showed modest improvements, likely reflecting nonspecific treatment effects such as placebo or general engagement. However, the between-group comparison revealed a significant advantage for NFT, with children who received portable EEG-based NFT exhibiting greater reductions in ADHD symptoms compared to controls. These findings suggest that portable EEG-based NFT yields meaningful improvements in core ADHD symptoms, including inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, and supports its potential as a scalable and sustainable alternative to traditional interventions, such as pharmacological treatments.",2025,Applied neuropsychology.

41467484,"Traumatic Optic Neuropathy After Head Trauma: Pathophysiology, Interventions, and Evidence From Meta-Analysis.","Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is a vision-threatening complication of craniofacial trauma that often progresses to optic nerve atrophy and irreversible visual loss. However, the optimal management strategy remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of surgical optic canal decompression versus corticosteroid therapy in patients with TON. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between January 2005 and July 2025. Both randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting visual or structural outcomes were included. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and subgroup analyses were performed according to intervention timing, type of injury, and baseline severity. Risk of bias was assessed with RoB 2.0 and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Thirty-four studies involving 1046 patients were included. Surgical decompression significantly improved visual outcomes compared with corticosteroids (62% vs. 37%; OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.55-3.56). Subgroup analyses indicated superior outcomes with early surgery (≤ 7 days; OR = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.74-4.88) and in indirect TON (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.70-4.04), whereas benefits were less pronounced in direct injuries. Structural outcomes also favored surgery, with greater retinal nerve fiber layer preservation (mean difference = +9.4 μm) and lower incidence of optic atrophy (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.27-0.71). Adverse events were mild and comparable between groups. Funnel plot analysis revealed no significant asymmetry, suggesting minimal publication bias. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides indicative evidence that early surgical decompression may offer superior outcomes compared with corticosteroid therapy, especially for indirect injuries. Specifically, this meta-analysis suggests that surgical intervention may offer superior outcomes without increasing adverse events. Nevertheless, the evidence base remains limited, and these results should be interpreted with caution. While corticosteroids alone show limited benefit and may be considered adjunctive when surgery is not feasible, high-quality multicenter randomized trials are urgently needed to standardize treatment protocols and optimize patient outcomes.",2025,ANZ journal of surgery,L1_scientific_engagement
41467304,Role of nut and seed intake on telomere length as a biomarker of ageing: A systematic review of observational and interventional studies.,"Telomere length is a biomarker of ageing, with shorter lengths associated with higher risk of age-related diseases and mortality. Oxidative stress and inflammation predominantly contribute to telomere shortening. Diets rich in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may help preserve telomere length. Nuts and seeds contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients and bioactive compounds. Their consumption is recognised as protective against age-related conditions. The objective of this review is to evaluate the role of nut and seed intake on telomere length in humans. A systematic search was conducted in four databases from inception to 12 March 2024 to identify observational and interventional studies assessing nut and seed intake and measured telomere length as an outcome in adults (aged ≥18 years). Data from the included articles were extracted by one reviewer and verified by another reviewer. Out of the nine observational studies included, three reported positive associations between nut and seed intake and telomere length. None of the four interventional studies included reported a significant positive effect. Meta-analysis was not performed due to high variability in reporting telomere length measurements. The evidence is insufficient to confirm a beneficial role of nut and seed intake on telomere length. Adequately powered long-term intervention studies are needed.",2025,The British journal of nutrition,L1_scientific_engagement
41467274,Copeptin as a prognostic biomarker in heart failure: a comprehensive review.,"Heart failure (HF) poses a major global health burden due to its high prevalence, complexity, and poor prognosis. Although biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) are widely used for diagnosis and risk stratification, additional biomarkers are needed to refine prognostication. Copeptin, a stable fragment of pre-provasopressin, reflects vasopressin system activity and has emerged as a promising prognostic tool. Elevated copeptin levels correlate with increased mortality, hospitalizations, and disease progression in both acute and chronic HF. It offers early detection of hemodynamic stress and complements traditional markers, especially in multimarker strategies. This review explores copeptin's physiological role, its predictive value in various HF phenotypes, and its integration into clinical risk models. Evidence supports its utility in identifying high-risk patients, guiding therapy, and monitoring disease evolution. Challenges to clinical adoption include assay standardization, cost-effectiveness, and establishing universally accepted cutoffs. Future directions focus on copeptin-guided therapies, AI-driven predictive models, and its role in precision medicine. Continued research may solidify copeptin's role in optimizing heart failure management through individualized risk assessment and tailored interventions.",2025,Folia medica,L1_scientific_engagement
41467260,Evaluation of Intravenous Thrombolytic Therapy on Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcome: A Single-center Observation Prospective Cohort Study.,"Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We started IVT about 4 years ago (since 2017) in our center. The aim of the thrombolysis outcome in ischemic stroke study was to confirm whether the efficacy and safety of IVT recognized in published studies could be reproduced in routine clinical practice in Iran. This study was a prospective observational cohort study on consecutive patients diagnosed with AIS, who received IVT from January 2017 to March 2019 (ClinicalTrials registration: NCT04309357). The primary outcome was the rate of functional independence at 3 months, defined as the Barthel Index (BI) 85-100. Binary outcomes included independence compared with disability or death. The secondary outcome was the rate of fatal and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Out of 214 patients registered in this study, 59.34% were male and the median (interquartile range) age of patients was 69 (61-78) years. Pretreatment median scores of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale were 3 and 10, respectively. At discharge time, 40.65% of patients achieved good outcomes. Follow-up within 3 months, 43.45% achieved BI 85-100, and 44.72% had an mRS score 0-2. The rate of all types of intracranial hemorrhages was 19.6%, of which 9.3% were symptomatic. In addition, the mortality rate during the 3 months was 17.28%. In our study, the efficacy of IVT was reasonable compared to international data. However, to increase efficiency, poststroke rehabilitation programs need to be organized and promoted.",2025,Acta neurologica Taiwanica,L1_scientific_engagement
41467214,Ethics based educational interventions on end-of-life care for undergraduate nursing students: A scoping review.,"Nurses face various ethical dilemmas and conflicts in end-of-life care; however, there is no evidence of effective undergraduate ethics education on the topic settings to address them. This review aimed to describe educational interventions for end-of-life care focused on ethical content in undergraduate nursing education and their outcomes for students. This review used Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage scoping process. This study used the Ovid (CINAHL and MEDLINE) and PubMed bibliographic databases from 2012 to 2023. We included literature on qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods research that could provide information about ethical end-of-life care (EOLC) education interventions in undergraduate nursing programs. We excluded review articles to avoid duplication. The search string included (""education, nursing"" OR ""education, nursing, baccalaureate"") AND (""ethics"") OR (""terminal care"" OR ""hospice care"" OR ""end of life care"" OR ""palliative care""). The scope of this study was limited to studies on educational interventions for EOLC ethics in undergraduate nursing education. The search yielded 4190 articles, of which 25 were included in the analysis. Fourteen of the 25 studies were conducted in the USA, whereas the others were conducted in various parts of the world. No intervention research articles were found that focused on EOLC ethics itself, which was either incorporated as part of the nursing education for EOLC or included in ethics education as an EOLC case study. Of these, 17 studies included lectures to teach EOLC ethics, and four used scenarios and case studies as teaching methods. Twelve studies used scenarios for simulation education. Seven studies combined lectures and simulations. The lectures improved students' knowledge and attitudes toward death, and their confidence in EOLC. As a result of the simulation intervention, in addition to improvements in knowledge and attitudes, participants gained communication skills, comfort with caregiving, confidence, self-efficacy, and the ability to reflect on their attitudes. The results suggest that while lectures are effective for acquiring ethical knowledge and attitudes related to EOLC based on ethical competency, simulations are more effective for acquiring practical skills such as communication, self-efficacy, and reflection. Incorporating ethical issues in simulations is hoped to broadly develop ethical practice competencies.",2026,International journal of nursing studies advances,L1_scientific_engagement
41467204,Risk of reclassification and novel tools in active surveillance.,"Low-risk prostate cancer usually has an indolent course, and in this scenario, active surveillance (AS) is currently the preferred management, reducing overtreatment without compromising oncologic outcomes in well-selected patients. Two pillars of this strategy are patient selection and adequate monitoring strategy to detect early progression, leading to active treatment in the window of curability. The aim of this review is to assess the novel available tools and their role in AS. We conducted a comprehensive review of the current literature addressing the risk of reclassification and studies evaluating traditional and emerging diagnostic and prognostic tools, including imaging modalities, biomarkers, and genomic classifiers, which could decrease reclassification rates and minimize the burden of serial exams during follow-up and, especially, the frequency of biopsies, which are still necessary to evaluate progression. The most significant follow-up cohorts demonstrate long-term treatment rates ranging from 30% to 45%, and 36% of low-risk prostate cancer patients have an upgrade in radical prostatectomy specimens. Despite the emergence of new diagnostic and prognostic tools, few of them have been validated or included in the assessment of eligible patients for AS. In the current guidelines, a combination of cT stage, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen value, prostate-specific antigen density, and number of positive cores in biopsy is used to select patients for AS. However, various risk factors have been associated with the risk of reclassification, which reveals the need to incorporate better tools that may contribute to better risk stratification of patients eligible for AS. Although AS is feasible and safe, the risk of progression is of great concern for patients and physicians, and monitoring is also an important part of the therapeutic strategy. Novel risk stratification tools are promising but need further validation to improve results and decrease the burden and anxiety that monitoring can bring to patients.",2025,Asian journal of urology,L1_scientific_engagement
41467201,Effectiveness of virtual reality to manage pain and anxiety in patients undergoing cystoscopy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) distraction technologies in managing pain and anxiety in patients undergoing cystoscopy procedures. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to July 2024, for studies comparing the use of VR distraction technologies versus no VR distraction in patients undergoing cystoscopy. The primary endpoints evaluated were patient-reported anxiety and procedural pain scores, and post-procedural heart rate (HR). Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed with the use of a random-effects model. The statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.4. A total of 575 patients from four randomized controlled trials were included, of whom 289 (50%) underwent the cystoscopy procedure using VR distraction technologies. The mean age of all patients was 57.25 years old, and 395 (69%) of them were male. In our pooled analysis, we did not observe a statistically significant reduction in patient-reported procedural pain (SMD -0.16; 95% CI -0.32-0.00; In this comprehensive meta-analysis comprising 575 patients who underwent cystoscopy, the use of VR was not associated with a significant difference in pain, anxiety, or HR levels.",2025,Asian journal of urology,L1_scientific_engagement
41467195,Prostate cancer screening.,"To examine the current status and future perspectives of prostate cancer (PCa) screening. We conducted a narrative review of randomized controlled trials focused on PCa screening and treatment. This review specifically focused on population-based trials enrolling men at average risk of PCa. Prostate-specific antigen has been the cornerstone of PCa screening since its clinical introduction in the late 1980s. Four contemporary high-quality randomized controlled trials assessed the efficacy of a prostate-specific antigen-based screening program on PCa mortality. We address conflicting results and differences among these trials. In recent years, MRI has gained significance, particularly in the targeted diagnostic pathway of PCa. Four randomized controlled trials and one cohort study have evaluated its use in PCa screening programs. Additionally, three pivotal trials have investigated the impact of radical PCa treatment on mortality, indirectly evaluating the utility of screening protocols. Current positions of major society guidelines are also addressed. Risk-adapted strategies, considering combined factors, are envisioned as the future towards precision medicine. PCa screening has demonstrated a benefit in terms of reducing PCa mortality after 10 years of follow-up. Nevertheless, its application is not without risks, so a shared decision-making process must be ensured between the patient and the clinician. Emerging tools such as MRI, genetic panels, and new biomarkers show promising opportunities to reduce these harms and the overdiagnosis of low-risk cancers. An individualized approach for each patient, based on detected risks and clinical parameters, helps guide different clinical pathways.",2025,Asian journal of urology,L1_scientific_engagement

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is generally avoided due to its invasiveness and the requirement for fluoroscopy. This study aimed to review the literature on the use of PCNL in pregnancy, focusing on its safety, efficacy, feasibility, and technical aspects. A narrative literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases, covering the period from January 2000 to March 2024. The search terms included ""percutaneous nephrolithotomy"", ""PCNL"", ""pregnancy"", and relevant variations thereof. The initial search retrieved 27 articles, of which only six studies involving 14 patients met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed studies included patients aged 23-34 years who underwent PCNL between 8 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation. Preoperative evaluations were exclusively based on ultrasound imaging, with stone sizes ranging from 8 mm to 48 mm. Indications for PCNL were persistent pain despite urinary diversion or reluctance to undergo stent replacement. Fluoroscopy was avoided in 13 patients. No maternal or fetal complications were reported. PCNL appears to be a safe and feasible treatment option for selected cases of urinary stone disease during pregnancy. It should be performed in experienced centers, with proper patient counseling and a multidisciplinary approach to ensure the best outcomes.",2025,Asian journal of urology,L1_scientific_engagement
41467190,"Advancements in artificial intelligence for prostate cancer: Optimizing diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic assessment.","This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape on artificial intelligence (AI) in prostate cancer (PCa) management, highlighting its potential to enhance diagnosis, improve medical image quality, facilitate risk stratification, and aid prognosis. The review also identifies opportunities and challenges associated with integrating AI into clinical practice. This review synthesizes findings from recent studies on AI applications in PCa management. It examines the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in diagnostic imaging, surgical skill assessment, and outcome prediction. The analysis emphasizes empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy and limitations of AI models in clinical settings. AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, is improving diagnostic accuracy by analyzing medical images with greater efficiency and precision compared to traditional methods. AI-based tools are also being developed for surgical skill assessment, offering objective evaluations and feedback to surgeons. Additionally, AI applications in predicting patient outcomes are facilitating the creation of personalized treatment plans. Empirical evidence shows that AI models exhibit higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting clinically significant PCa, outperforming conventional diagnostic techniques. AI holds significant promise for transforming PCa management by improving diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and enhancing patient outcomes. While the evidence underscores its potential, challenges such as the need for larger, more diverse datasets and addressing implementation barriers remain critical. Despite these hurdles, the benefits of AI in PCa management represent a compelling area for future research and clinical integration.",2025,Asian journal of urology,L1_scientific_engagement
41467165,Tumor enhancement by magnetic resonance imaging after endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation for small pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare and often diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting curative options. For PNETs <20 mm, endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive therapeutic alternative. This study investigates the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in monitoring postablation enhancement, emphasizing its utility in assessing treatment efficacy. Four PNETs in the uncinate process, measuring <15 mm, underwent EUS-RFA (insulinomas [2 patients]; nonfunctioning PNETs [2 patients]). MRI was performed immediately (2 patients) and 30 days (2 patients) after EUS-RFA to confirm tumor destruction, with enhancement analysis as the main marker of effective ablation. The diagnostic confirmation of all PNETs was obtained through EUS fine-needle biopsy before EUS-RFA. One insulinoma required 2 sessions (25%), whereas the other 3 needed only 1 EUS-RFA session (75%). All 5 sessions were technically successful (100%) and clinically effective in 75% of cases after a single application. Mild duodenal bleeding was observed in case 4 (20%). MRI demonstrated complete destruction of the nodules in all cases. EUS-RFA is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for both functioning and nonfunctioning PNETs <20 mm. It offers a minimally invasive alternative for patients unfit for or unwilling to undergo surgery or active surveillance.

41467156,Scar incision and endoscopic balloon dilation for severe benign esophageal strictures.,"Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) is the primary treatment for benign esophageal strictures after endoscopic or surgical resection of esophageal cancer. Resolving these strictures often requires multiple sessions over time and risks perforation. To address these challenges, we developed a combined technique integrating scar incision with EBD, wherein scar incisions are created using a needle-knife before balloon dilation. Linear incisions were made at the stricture site using a needle-knife, targeting areas with pronounced fibrosis or requiring tension release. Subsequently, EBD was performed to dilate the entire stricture site. These procedures were performed in 1 session. Additional EBD or EBD with scar incision sessions were conducted at intervals until patients became asymptomatic. We evaluated EBD with scar incision in 5 patients with severe esophageal strictures after endoscopic or surgical resection for esophageal cancer. All patients became asymptomatic within 3 months. One patient experienced restricture 139 days after the final EBD but improved after an additional EBD session. No adverse events requiring intervention occurred. EBD with scar incision effectively achieves asymptomatic resolution within a short period.

41467025,Novel and emerging physical treatments for major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), a widespread psychiatric disease with significant impacts on neurological functioning and quality of life, affects 4.4% of the global population. Despite the availability of various treatments, including antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, approximately 50% of patients with MDD exhibit inadequate responses, leading to treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This review evaluates novel physical treatments for depression, focusing on music therapy, light therapy, cold therapy, and brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Music therapy leverages the emotional and social benefits of music to improve mood and cognitive function. Light therapy influences circadian rhythms and neurotransmitter modulation to reduce depressive symptoms. Cold therapy, by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neurotransmitter systems, offers a promising approach for depression management. Brain stimulation techniques, including rTMS, tDCS, and DBS, provide non-pharmacological alternatives by modulating brain activity and connectivity. Although these novel treatments show potential, significant variabilities in clinical outcomes highlight the need for personalized treatment strategies. Future research should prioritize elucidating the mechanisms of these therapies, optimizing treatment protocols, and conducting larger randomized controlled trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety. The integration of advanced technologies and comprehensive mechanistic analyses will be crucial for advancing the field and improving treatment outcomes for MDD.",2025,Fundamental research,L1_scientific_engagement

While current treatments demonstrate limited efficacy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive intervention. This review synthesizes preclinical and clinical evidence, highlighting rTMS mechanisms-including enhanced neuroplasticity, normalizing network connectivity, and reducing neuroinflammation. We then propose five innovative strategies, including accelerated protocols, precision targeting using neuroimaging, neuroinformatic approaches, closed-loop systems, and biomarker-guided treatment. By bridging circuit-level insights with clinical innovation, rTMS offers a transformative approach to PTSD treatment, though standardization and personalized paradigms require further development and validation.

Additional keywords targeted mechanistic overlap, including ""receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand,"" ""osteoprotegerin,"" ""interleukin-6,"" and ""tumor necrosis factor-alpha."" The search prioritized epidemiological studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, and basic scientific reports. Supplementary sources included hand-searching reference lists, Google Scholar, and conference abstracts from the International Association for Dental Research, European Federation of Periodontology, and American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Inclusion was limited to English-language peer-reviewed articles addressing epidemiological, biological, diagnostic, or therapeutic links. Non-human studies, case reports, and editorials were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts, with consensus resolving discrepancies. Evidence reveals consistent associations between low systemic bone mineral density and increased periodontal attachment loss, particularly in postmenopausal women, mediated by the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) axis and proinflammatory cytokines. Shared risk factors such as aging, smoking, diabetes, and estrogen deficiency amplify susceptibility. Antiresorptive therapies may preserve alveolar bone, whereas periodontal treatment reduces systemic inflammation. Clinical implications include cross-screening and multidisciplinary care to mitigate the risks of fracture and tooth loss. Limitations include study heterogeneity and reliance on a cross-sectional design.

41466896,"Collagen-Based Interventions for Meniscal Tears: A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes, Safety, and MRI Findings.","Meniscal tears represent a significant clinical challenge worldwide, with traditional treatments ranging from conservative management to meniscectomy. Collagen-based interventions have emerged as promising alternatives, including collagen meniscus implant, arthroscopic matrix-based meniscus repair, and oral collagen supplementation. Despite their growing use, the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of these treatments are unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes, safety, and structural changes of these three collagen-based interventions for meniscal pathology. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Meta-Analyses and Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically searched five electronic databases for studies evaluating collagen-based interventions in adults with meniscopathy. The included studies reported functional outcomes, quality of life measures, or pain scores using validated instruments. Study designs included randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and case series. Quality assessment was conducted using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 27 studies involving 1,264 patients were included. The collagen meniscus implant demonstrated sustained functional improvement over extended follow-up periods with Lysholm scores ranging from 80 to 95 and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores of 77-95; however, MRI revealed predominant partial resorption (79%-92% of cases), frequent meniscal extrusion (68%-72%), and failure rates ranging from 1.5% to 40% (averaging 11%-12%). Arthroscopic matrix-based meniscus repair showed progressive improvement with subjective IKDC scores advancing from 77-79 at two years to 85-89 at 10 years, and Lysholm scores improving from 88-89 at two years to 92-93 at 10 years. MRI evaluations demonstrated favorable structural outcomes with 85% achieving Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS) scores ≤1, and lower failure rates (4%-21%). Oral supplementation provided rapid symptomatic relief within one to three months with significant improvements in pain (Visual Analog Score (VAS): 4.0) and quality of life (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): 52.4). No major adverse events were reported. However, collagen meniscal implant (CMI) showed higher revision surgery rates. Arthroscopic matrix-based meniscus repair (AMMR) appears most favorable for long-term outcomes in complex tears, demonstrating superior structural preservation and lower failure rates compared to CMI. CMI remains an option for partial deficiency despite high resorption rates, while oral supplementation provides a safe, conservative management option. However, these findings must be interpreted cautiously due to the absence of direct comparative studies and substantial heterogeneity. Robust head-to-head randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols are essential for evidence-based clinical decision-making.",2025,Cureus,L1_scientific_engagement

Neither the time-weighted rSPID Tegileridine showed comparable or slightly superior analgesic efficacy to oliceridine for moderate-to-severe pain following MIE. These findings support that tegileridine may provide promising profiles for postoperative pain management.",2025,"Drug design, development and therapy",L1_scientific_engagement
41466856,Inflammatory Skin Disease in Latin America: Treatment Challenges and Opportunities.,"Inflammatory skin diseases, including psoriasis (PsO), atopic dermatitis (AD), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and alopecia areata (AA), are chronic immune-mediated disorders that substantially impair the quality of life and impose a growing socioeconomic burden. In Latin America (LA), these conditions unfold in the context of structural inequality, fragmented health systems, and limited epidemiological data. Our objective was to review the epidemiology, awareness, and treatment landscape of PsO, AD, HS, and AA in Latin America, highlighting regional guidelines, real-world studies, and unmet needs. A narrative review was performed by integrating data from peer-reviewed publications, national and regional guidelines, registry analyses, and real-world studies published until 2025. The prevalence of PsO in LA ranges from 0.5% to 2%, AD affects 2-3% of adults, HS prevalence is estimated at 0.3-0.5%, and AA lifetime risk approximates 1-2%. Across conditions, awareness among patients and non-specialists remains low, contributing to delayed diagnosis and undertreatment. National guidelines, recently updated in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, broadly align with international standards, adapting recommendations to local resource and reimbursement constraints. Biologic and targeted therapies have transformed disease management; however, access remains inequitable, limited by high costs, fragmented insurance systems, and slow regulatory approval processes. Emerging real-world evidence from registries such as MEASURE-AD, RENAAC (AA), and national HS cohorts confirms therapeutic benefit but highlights persistent disparities and data gaps. Despite major advances in therapeutic innovation, LA faces continuing inequities in access and outcomes for inflammatory skin diseases. Coordinated regional registries, harmonized clinical guidelines, and policy reforms to accelerate drug approval and reimbursement are essential to achieve equitable dermatologic care. Many people in Latin America live with long-lasting skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema (atopic dermatitis), hidradenitis suppurativa, and alopecia areata (patchy hair loss). These conditions can affect comfort, confidence, work, and relationships. New medicines can help, but access is uneven. We wrote this review to explain what is known about these conditions in Latin America and to show where care can improve. We read studies, national clinical guidelines, and real-world reports from across the region. We looked at how common these conditions are, how they are recognized, and how they are treated. Awareness is low among the public and among some non-specialist clinicians. This leads to late diagnosis, especially for hidradenitis suppurativa.Countries have created clinical guidelines that broadly match international standards. These guidelines support step-by-step care, from creams and light therapy to tablets and new targeted medicines.Access to advanced treatments is still limited. Long approval timelines, costs, and gaps between public and private care delay treatment for many people.Real-world studies from Latin America show that targeted medicines can improve symptoms and quality of life when people can get them. People in Latin America deserve timely, effective skin care no matter where they live or how much they earn. Clear guidelines now exist; the next step is to make them real in everyday clinics. Faster approval, fair insurance coverage, stronger primary-care training, and shared regional registries would help more people get the right treatment at the right time.",2025,Journal of inflammation research,L1_scientific_engagement
41466841,Cutting edge developments in bone oncology - Highlights from the Cancer and Bone Society 2024 annual meeting.,"The 2024 Annual Conference of the Cancer and Bone Society (CABS), held jointly with the Bone Research Society at the University of Sheffield, highlighted the Society's enduring mission to advance understanding of cancer-bone interactions through collaboration, mentorship, and scientific excellence. Established from the early Cancer Induced Bone Disease meetings and re-emerging as an independent body in 2016, CABS continues to serve as a global community bridging basic, translational, and clinical research. This year's meeting featured a comprehensive scientific program spanning tumor-bone biology, therapeutic innovation, and microenvironmental regulation. Clinical sessions emphasized the evolution of bone-targeted treatments such as bisphosphonates, denosumab, and radiopharmaceuticals, alongside predictive biomarkers to guide personalized care. Presentations on renal cell carcinoma bone metastases, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer underscored persistent clinical challenges and opportunities for integration of immunotherapies and precision radiotherapy. Molecular sessions revealed how non-coding RNAs, TGF-β/Gli2 signaling, metabolic dependencies, and stromal mediators-including osteomodulin, IL-1β, and adiponectin-govern tumor colonization, dormancy, and resistance. Advances in immuno-oncology demonstrated the potential of γδ CAR-T cells, oncolytic viruses, and immune-metabolic targeting to enhance therapeutic efficacy in the bone microenvironment. Spatial and single-cell profiling provided unprecedented resolution of the metastatic niche, identifying novel osteoblast-derived stromal subsets and neurovascular remodeling as key determinants of disease progression. Complementary preclinical models and computational simulations, including 3D engineered bone marrow constructs and micro-finite element analysis, offered new frameworks to study therapeutic responses and fracture risk. The meeting also celebrated the growing leadership of Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs), whose contributions extended beyond research presentations to creative networking and mentorship events. These efforts reflected CABS' commitment to inclusivity, community building, and sustaining the next generation of leaders in cancer and bone research. Collectively, the 2024 CABS Annual Conference captured a transformative moment in the field-where mechanistic discoveries, advanced modeling, and translational collaboration converge to improve outcomes for patients with skeletal malignancies. As CABS looks ahead to the 2026 meeting in Tampa, Florida, the Society remains steadfast in fostering global partnerships and advancing integrative approaches to conquer cancer in bone.",2025,Journal of bone oncology,L1_scientific_engagement
41466828,Comparison of outcomes of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists for atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception through May 2025 to collect relevant clinical studies comparing the use of DOAC versus VKA for the treatment of patients with AF combined with chronic kidney disease. Literature screening, data extraction, analysis, quality evaluation, and risk of bias assessment were conducted by independent reviewers. The outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software, with I 16 studies were included in the analysis. Compared with VKA, DOAC can significantly reduced the risks of cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.78; 95 %CI 0.70-0.87; P < 0.05), major bleeding (HR = 0.79; 95 %CI 0.64-0.97; P < 0.05), and intracranial hemorrhage (HR = 0.50; 95 %CI 0.37-0.66; P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the DOAC and VKA groups regarding all-cause death (HR = 0.98; 95 %CI 0.81-1.19; P = 0.82), stroke or systemic embolism (HR = 0.84; 95 %CI 0.68-1.04; P = 0.12), gastrointestinal bleeding (HR = 0.87; 95 %CI 0.61-1.24; P = 0.43), myocardial infarction (HR = 0.98; 95 %CI 0.78-1.23; P = 0.84), or stroke (HR = 0.85; 95 %CI 0.72-1.00; P = 0.06). Overall, DOACs demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing cardiovascular mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Among patients with end-stage renal disease, those treated with DOACs showed a tendency toward reduced major bleeding (HR = 0.58; 95 % CI 0.50-0.68; P < 0.05), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (HR = 0.65; 95 %CI 0.48-0.98 P < 0.05), and intracranial hemorrhage (HR = 0.56; 95 % CI, 0.38-0.82; P < 0.05). For patients without end-stage renal disease, the DOAC group had greater benefits in reducing the risks of all-cause death (HR = 0.91; 95 %CI 0.84-0.99; P = 0.03), cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.77; 95 %CI 0.69-0.86; P < 0.05), major bleeding (HR = 0.85; 95 %CI 0.77-0.83; P < 0.05, and intracranial hemorrhage (HR = 0.42; 95 % CI, 0.28-0.65; P < 0.05). Conversely, the VKA group was more effective in reducing the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage events (HR = 1.38; 95 % CI 1.13-1.68; P < 0.05). In patients with non-valvular AF complicated by CKD, the use of DOAC is associated with a moderate reduction in the risks of cardiovascular mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage. Among patients with end-stage renal disease, DOACs offer more significant benefits in reducing the risks of major bleeding, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and intracranial hemorrhage. For patients with non-end-stage renal disease, DOAC are associated with lower rates of all-cause death, cardiovascular mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage, whereas VKA are linked to an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.",2025,International journal of cardiology.

41466814,Integrating Human Expertise With Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models for Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Retinal Fluid and Pathology Quantification: A Systematic Review.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and intensive learning show promise in ophthalmology, using optical coherence tomography (OCT) to diagnose conditions such as diabetic retinopathy. However, precise segmentation of retinal fluid remains challenging, especially in atypical cases and low-quality scans. In hospital settings, manual segmentation is time-consuming; however, integrating human expertise with AI could improve efficiency and accuracy in quantifying retinal pathologies. This review assesses the efficacy of human-AI collaborative workflows for enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and clinical utility of retinal pathology quantification in OCT. We conducted a systematic review of the literature from 2021 to 2025 across three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. This review included nine studies that quantified retinal pathology using human-AI collaborative workflows in OCT. Two independent reviewers screened the records, extracted relevant data, including study design, AI architecture, and performance metrics, and assessed the quality of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies - 2nd version (QUADAS-2 ) and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools.  This systematic review of nine AI-OCT studies (2021-2025) found that hybrid AI-clinician workflows achieved expert-level reliability for 11 of 13 retinal biomarkers across cohorts of 16-1,097 individuals. AI architectures, including U-Net variants, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)-Net, and custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs), performed well for well-defined features such as retinal layers (Dice 0.94), intraretinal/subretinal fluid (Dice 0.61-0.67), and atrophic areas (F1 0.78-0.89), but struggled with complex biomarkers like sub-retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) lesions (Dice 0.11). Clinician agreement on fluid volumes was strong (Pearson r > 0.85), though volumetric errors increased in atrophic regions. These workflows reduced processing time by over 50% compared with manual grading while improving monitoring precision for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa complications in both single-center and international trial settings. Combining AI quantification with clinician expertise enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of retinal pathology assessments. This integration supports personalized treatment planning and facilitates large-scale research. Hybrid approaches address AI's limitations, highlighting their practicality for clinical use in ophthalmology. We suggest incorporating hybrid AI-human workflows in clinical practice to improve the efficiency and accuracy of OCT analysis. Future developments in AI should focus on standardized training for complex biomarkers, such as sub-RPE lesions.",2025,Cureus,L1_scientific_engagement
41466746,Lysosomal storage diseases in North America: a comprehensive review of enzyme therapies and unmet needs.,"This review explores enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) for lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), focusing on disease characteristics, mechanisms of action, clinical benefits, limitations, and implications for patient care and access. LSDs are a group of over 50 rare, inherited metabolic disorders caused by mutations affecting lysosomal enzymes, membrane proteins, or transporters. This leads to the accumulation of undegraded macromolecules in tissues such as the CNS (central nervous system), heart, and muscles, resulting in progressive dysfunction and possible death. ERTs, approved by FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and the EMA (European Medicines Agency), have been the cornerstone of treatment since 1995, significantly improving the patient's quality of life reducing organ damage and stabilizing cardiac and renal function. However, ERTs require lifelong intravenous infusions and have limited efficacy to treat CNS symptoms due to their inability to cross the BBB (blood-brain barrier). Some patients develop immune responses known as ADA (anti-drug antibody), which can compromise treatment effectiveness. Emerging research into nanotechnology and combination therapies may help overcome these limitations. Newer formulations such as pegunigalsidase (Elfabrio®) use for FD (Fabry disease), exhibit lower affinity for developing ADA compared to other ERTs, offer reduced immunogenicity and safety profiles enhancement. Cost remains a major barrier, with annual treatment expenses often exceeding hundreds of thousands of dollars. Access to ERT is uneven, particularly in underfunded healthcare systems. In North America, reimbursement varies by region and payer, potentially delaying treatment and impacting outcomes. This review draws from MEDLINE, Cochrane Reviews, and PubMed (1984-2025) using search terms such as LSDs, ERTs, rare diseases, Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and others. Ongoing research and health policy reforms are essential to improve access, equity, and therapeutic outcomes for patients with LSDs.",2025,Therapeutic advances in rare disease,L1_scientific_engagement
41466613,Therapeutic strategies based on macrophages and their derivatives: Targeted drug delivery platforms and disease treatment.,"Targeted drug delivery platforms are designed to enable spatiotemporal precision in transporting therapeutic agents to disease-specific sites, thereby optimizing therapeutic efficacy and mitigating off-target adverse effects. Despite their clinical promise, these platforms remain hindered by substantial translational barriers. Macrophages, with inherent biocompatibility and intrinsic tropism toward inflamed/diseased tissues, are critically involved in diverse pathological processes. Macrophage-based drug delivery systems (MDDSs) have emerged as promising platforms engineered via therapeutic cargo loading onto intact cells, cell-membrane coatings, extracellular vesicles (EVs), or hitchhiking mechanisms. This review delineates existing MDDS platforms, critically analyzing their respective merits and constraints. We further elucidate therapeutic mechanisms and clinical implementations of MDDSs for cancer, atherosclerosis (AS), and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, while establishing a systematic taxonomy of their biomedical applications. Specifically, we highlight the transformative potential of gene-editing technologies (exemplified by chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR-M) therapy and antigen-independent strategies) in innovating next-generation MDDS architectures. We summarize state-of-the-art developments, persisting translational hurdles, and optimization roadmaps for MDDSs, providing a conceptual framework to guide their translational advancement.",2025,Journal of pharmaceutical analysis,L1_scientific_engagement
41466583,[Lack of early response to psychotherapy for depression predicts treatment non-response].,"Many patients with depressive disorder do not recover after psychotherapy. It is unclear for how long treatment should be continued unchanged for patients showing limited progress. Examine whether early non-response is a predictor of treatment outcome in patients with moderate to severe depression and when the predictive value is highest. Per-protocol analyses were performed with 252 moderately to severely depressed patients. Participants were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of either short-term psychodynamic supportive psychotherapy (SPSP) or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The predictive value of early non-response (&lt; 20% reduction of symptoms of the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) at week 1, 2, and 4 for treatment non-response at week 8 (&lt; 50% reduction of symptoms) was evaluated with logistic regression. Early non-response was a moderate to strong predictor of final non-response in week 8. The predictive value was highest in week 4 (odds ratio: 12.1; p &lt; 0,001; AUC: 0.78). Most early non-responders remained non-responder after treatment (84% of non-responders in week 1 to 93% of non-responders in week 4). Early non-response indicates little chance of treatment response and may indicate that changes in depression management should be considered earlier than conventionally thought.",2025,Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,L1_scientific_engagement
41466543,Prolotherapy for temporomandibular joint disorders: an updated comprehensive review.,"Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) comprise multifactorial conditions involving pain, joint noises, and restricted mandibular motion. Prolotherapy, involving intra-articular or periarticular injection of proliferative agents such as hypertonic dextrose or polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), has recently gained attention as a regenerative therapy for refractory TMDs. This review summarizes current evidence and biological mechanisms underlying prolotherapy in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Literature searches identified clinical and experimental studies evaluating efficacy, safety, and treatment protocols. Prolotherapy promotes fibroblast activation, collagen synthesis, and ligamentous stabilization. Dextrose remains the most validated proliferant, while PDRN provides comparable efficacy with less discomfort and shorter treatment intervals. Clinical data consistently show reduced pain and improved maximum mouth opening across chronic and degenerative TMJ cases, with preliminary imaging evidence of subchondral bone remodeling. Reported adverse events are minimal and transient. Prolotherapy appears to be a regenerative approach that may be regarded as one of the conservative treatment modalities for TMDs. Further controlled studies are needed to validate its long-term clinical and structural outcomes.",2025,Journal of the Korean Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,L1_scientific_engagement
41466382,From light to healing: photobiomodulation therapy in medical disciplines.,"Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) represents a rapidly expanding area of translational research that bridges photophysics, mitochondrial biology, and clinical rehabilitation. It leverages low-level light to modulate cellular bioenergetics, inflammatory signaling, and tissue repair processes across various medical disciplines. A systematic literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science to identify recent clinical and mechanistic studies on PBMT. The gathered evidence was analyzed to evaluate the influence of PBMT on cytochrome c oxidase-mediated energy transduction, reactive oxygen species modulation, nitric oxide signaling, and cytokine regulation. Current findings indicate that PBMT exerts multifaceted effects on metabolism and immune homeostasis. Clinical applications have expanded from dermatology and wound healing to musculoskeletal, neurological, ophthalmic, and oncologic conditions. PBMT shows potential for symptom alleviation, accelerated recovery, and tissue protection under oxidative or inflammatory stress. However, translation from preclinical evidence to consistent clinical outcomes remains constrained by non-standardized dosimetry, inconsistent energy delivery, and heterogeneous study endpoints. Negative or equivocal outcomes in trials involving trained or low-stress cohorts highlight the context-dependent efficacy of PBMT. Immunoregulatory insights further reveal links between redox-sensitive transcriptional control and systemic cytokine balance. By integrating mechanistic and clinical perspectives, this review positions PBMT as a promising yet incompletely optimized platform for mechanism-guided phototherapy. Future directions include biomarker-guided treatment monitoring, advanced device engineering, and personalized PBMT modeling through optical and metabolic profiling to achieve its full translational and therapeutic potential.

41466370,Impact of free summer day camp on physical activity behaviors and screentime of elementary-age children from low-income households: a randomized clinical trial.,"To examine the efficacy of providing free summer day camp (SDC) to children from low-income families on changes in physical activity, time spent sedentary, and screentime. Across three summers (2021-2023), we randomized 422 children (8.2 ± 1.5yrs, 48% female, 51% Black, 69% at or below 200% Federal Poverty Level, 30% food insecure) from seven elementary schools to one of two conditions: summer as usual (control, n = 199) or free SDC for 8-10wks (intervention, n = 223). Accelerometry measured activity (moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA] and time spent sedentary) and parent daily report of screentime were measured using a 14-day in April/May (school) and July (summer). Intent-to-treat analysis examined changes in behaviors between school and summer. Exposure models examined differences in behaviors during summer on days when children attended vs. did not attend a SDC in both intervention and control children. Intent-to-treat models indicated in the summer children in the intervention group accumulated + 15.0 min/day (95CI 12.0 to 18.0) more MVPA and spent - 29.7 min/day (-37.7 to -21.8) less time sedentary and - 14.1 min/day (-23.9 to -4.3) on screens, compared to children in the control group. Exposure models indicated, on days children attended SDCs, they accumulated more MVPA (+ 26.1 min/day, 22.5 to 29.7), and spent less time sedentary (-63.5 min/day, -72.9 to -54.1) and on screens (-9.5 min/day, -20.1 to 1.2), compared to days when children did not attend SDC. Policies targeting upstream structural factors, such as universal access to existing community SDCs during summer, could lead to improvements in health behaviors among children from low-income households.

41466242,Effect of oral functional exercise combined with psychological intervention on oral frailty in older adults.,"To explore the intervention effect of oral functional exercise combined with psychological intervention on oral frailty in older adults. Ninety-six older adults with oral frailty treated in our hospital from August 2023 to April 2024 were randomly assigned to an observation group or a control group. The control group received routine oral care and health guidance, and the observation group added oral functional exercise combined with psychological intervention. After 3 months of intervention, the two groups were compared in oral function (chewing, swallowing), psychological status (SAS, SDS scores), oral health status, and self-efficacy before and after intervention. Before the intervention, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in oral functional indicators, SAS and SDS scores, Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) scores, or Self-Efficacy Scale for Oral Health (SESS) scores (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the observation group showed superior chewing function, swallowing function, and SESS scores compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The SAS, SDS, and OHIP-14 scores of the observation group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The combined oral functional exercise and psychological intervention effectively improved oral function, alleviated anxiety and depression, and enhanced oral health-related quality of life and self-efficacy among older adults with oral frailty. This intervention provides a feasible approach for managing oral frailty in older adults. Future multicenter studies and long-term follow-up data are needed to further validate its generalizability and sustainability, providing stronger evidence for clinical practice.

41466224,Early initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors within guideline-directed medical therapy and outcomes in newly diagnosed heart failure patients.,"Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of hospitalization and mortality. Early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) improves outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This study assesses the impact of starting GDMT with an SGLT2i in newly diagnosed HFrEF patients. The XXXX1 multicenter prospective registry enrolled consecutive newly diagnosed HFrEF patients between October 2021 and March 2022 to evaluate the influence of medical treatment schedules in newly diagnosed HFrEF. In this substudy, patients were grouped by initial GDMT with or without an SGLT2i. Over six months, clinical variables, echocardiographic and laboratory parameters, and clinical events (hospitalizations, emergency visits) were collected. The primary aim was to compare GDMT implementation (quadruple therapy rates), with secondary aims assessing efficacy (target doses) and safety (adverse events). Of 518 patients, 400 initiated treatment with an SGLT2i, while 118 did not, with no differences in the baseline characteristics. At six months, 81.5% of patients who started with an SGLT2i were on quadruple therapy, compared to 61.2% in the non-SGLT2i group (p = 0.0001). The group starting with an SGLT2i showed a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction at 3 months (14.2% vs 10.6%; p = 0.023) and preservation of renal function (GFR change: -4.7 vs + 0.4 mL/min; p = 0.011). Furthermore, patients who started on SGLT2i showed a trend toward fewer HF decompensations and a significantly lower rate of non-cardiovascular hospitalizations. Initiating GDMT with an SGLT2i facilitates the early implementation of quadruple therapy, improves LVEF, preserves renal function, and shows a trend toward reducing HF decompensations. SGLT2i initiation also demonstrated a favourable safety profile, supporting their early use in newly diagnosed HFrEF patients.",2025,BMC cardiovascular disorders,L1_scientific_engagement
41466213,Interventions to reduce kinesiophobia in breast cancer patients: a systematic review.,"Kinesiophobia is prevalent in breast cancer (BC) patients, often reducing physical activity and impairing rehabilitation outcomes. A systematic evaluation of interventions targeting kinesiophobia in this population is essential. To assess the characteristics and efficacy of interventions for reducing kinesiophobia in BC patients. We systematically searched seven databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, APA PsycInfo) for English-language studies from inception to May 2025. Eligible studies included Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental, and pre/post designs reporting kinesiophobia-related outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Eight studies (total sample size=404) evaluated seven interventions: pain neuroscience education (PNE) combined with therapeutic exercise (N=3), telerehabilitation-based relaxation (N=1), virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation (N=1), mirror therapy (MT) (N=1), complete decongestive therapy (CDT) (N=1), progressive supervised exercise (N=1), and health education (HE) (N=1). The interventions comprised 10-36 sessions delivered over 6-16 weeks, mostly therapist-delivered. Five studies were high-quality, with only two reporting non-significant effects. Preliminary evidence suggests PNE combined with therapeutic exercise, VR, MT, and progressive exercise may reduce kinesiophobia. However, the efficacy of HE alone, remotely supervised exercise, and CDT remains unclear. Overall, the effectiveness of interventions targeting kinesiophobia in BC patients appears to be mixed, and the evidence base for each intervention remains limited. Future studies should prioritize kinesiophobia as a primary outcome and strengthen the evidence through larger sample sizes, extended follow-up periods, and high-quality RCTs. CRD420251060712.

41466170,Adjunct tirofiban after intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke: a GRADE-guided meta-analysis of randomized trials with trial sequential analysis.,"Early platelet-mediated re-occlusion and microvascular ""no-reflow"" can blunt the benefits of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Tirofiban, a short-acting GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, may stabilize post-lysis reperfusion. Our analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunct tirofiban after IVT versus IVT alone (alteplase or Tenecteplase) in patients with AIS. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified through searches of PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science up to August 2025. Dichotomous outcomes were pooled as risk ratios (RRs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), each with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three RCTs with 1,132 patients were included. Tirofiban improved excellent outcome (64.09% vs. 54.24%, RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.33, P = 0.002) and functional independence (80.67% vs. 70.45%, RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.38, P = 0.01) and reduced poor outcome (19.32% vs. 29.54%, RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81, P = 0.0006). Early neurologic improvement favored tirofiban at 24-72 h (p = 0.001) but was neutral at 5-7 days (p = 0.25). Safety did not differ for any intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (p = 0.26), asymptomatic ICH (p = 0.75), symptomatic ICH (p = 0.68), systemic bleeding (p = 0.75), or 90-day mortality (p = 0.84). Across randomized trials, adjunct tirofiban after IVT improved 90-day functional outcomes and early neurologic recovery. For safety, no statistically significant differences were observed in any ICH, asymptomatic ICH, systemic bleeding, or 90-day mortality; however, the estimate for sICH was very imprecise and does not exclude a clinically important increase. These results are exploratory and warrant confirmation in larger, multinational RCTs before informing practice.",2025,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,L1_scientific_engagement
41466168,Efficacy and safety of intravenous tirofiban pre-operatively as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy in ischemic stroke: a grade-assessed systematic review and Meta-Analysis.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) is a significant cause of disability and mortality. While endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is the standard treatment, microvascular reperfusion remains a challenge. Although there is mixed information about the safety and effectiveness of tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, it may improve perfusion when administered before EVT. Its effects on risks and functional outcomes, including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), are investigated in this meta-analysis. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane from inception to July 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Cohorts comparing pre-EVT tirofiban with EVT alone in LVO stroke. Primary outcomes were 90-day functional independence and the ordinal shift in mRS. Secondary outcomes included mortality and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Six Studies (1,664 patients) were included. Tirofiban did not significantly improve 90-day functional independence (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.88-1.36; p = 0.44; I² = 62%) or ordinal mRS (MD: 0.06, 95% CI: -0.15 to 0.27; p = 0.58; I² = 0%). Mortality was similar between groups (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.54-1.06; p = 0.11; I² = 0%). sICH risk was also comparable (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.46-1.51; p = 0.55; I² = 28%). Pre-procedural tirofiban did not significantly raise the risk of sICH, improve functional outcomes, or lower death in LVO stroke patients having EVT. Although additional research may improve patient selection, these results point to limited value for routine tirofiban administration before EVT.Keypoints Pre-EVT tirofiban does not significantly improve 90-day functional outcomes in AIS due to LVO. No significant benefit was observed in ordinal modified Rankin Scale scores. Mortality and risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were similar between tirofiban and control groups. Heterogeneity was moderate to low, and findings were consistent across study types. Future studies should explore optimal patient selection, dosing strategies, and timing to identify potential subgroups that may benefit from pre-EVT tirofiban.",2025,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,L1_scientific_engagement
41466156,Efficacy and safety review of tosufloxacin in the treatment of bacterial infection in children.,"In recent years, the use of antibiotics in pediatric patients has received widespread. Tosufloxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial used to treat pneumonia, otitis media, cholera, and anthrax. Guidelines have recommended that quinolone antimicrobials can be used as alternatives for the treatment of bacterial infections in children. However, due to the potential adverse effects on bones and joints, the clinical application of fluoroquinolones requires further evaluation. This article reviewed the latest clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of tosufloxacin for treating bacterial infections in children.

41466065,Saliva-based molecular diagnostics in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): a non-invasive frontier in oncology.,"Saliva is increasingly recognized as a powerful, noninvasive biofluid for the diagnosis and monitoring of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), serving as a practical alternative to conventional liquid biopsy. Salivary circulatory DNA (ctDNA) detection in OSCC may exceed plasma levels. emphasizing saliva's susceptibility to local illness. Saliva collection is simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive, allowing for regular monitoring. Current evidence demonstrates its potential through a wide spectrum of salivary biomarkers. Identified salivary biomarkers include viral nucleic acids such as human papillomavirus (HPV), host-derived molecules such as proteins and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF), regulatory microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-31, miR-184), and extracellular vesicles containing tumor-specific cargo. Moreover, oral microbiome dysbiosis has been linked to malignant transformation and progression, highlighting saliva's ability to reflect complex tumor-host interactions. Technological progress in multi-omics profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) has enhanced the interpretation of these multidimensional datasets, supporting the design of more robust and individualized biomarker panels. Concurrently, point-of-care technologies, particularly microfluidic chips and biosensor platforms, are driving the development of rapid and portable saliva-based diagnostics.  CONCLUSION: The path toward clinical implementation is constrained by several factors: the absence of FDA-approved salivary assays for OSCC, reliance on relatively small and retrospective studies, and the lack of standardized protocols for collection, processing, and analysis. Despite these challenges, salivary diagnostics are advancing as a highly promising adjunct to established modalities such as histopathology and radiologic imaging. They hold potential in early disease detection, patient stratification, therapeutic monitoring, and surveillance of recurrence. Integrative models, such as liquid TNM staging-which combine salivary and blood-based biomarkers-may ultimately redefine cancer diagnostics and follow-up. To date, no saliva-based assay has received FDA approval for oral cancer, highlighting regulatory and validation shortcomings. For translation into practice, further validation through large-scale trials, regulatory endorsement, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness remain essential. Nonetheless, saliva-based assays stand out as accessible, patient-centered tools with significant implications for the future of head and neck oncology.",2025,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,L1_scientific_engagement
41466018,"A randomized, controlled, multicenter phase III clinical trial of Huo Xiang Zheng Qi oral liquid for the prevention and control of nausea and vomiting caused by multiday cisplatin-based regimen.","Standardized chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prevention in HEC is critical, yet NK1RAs remain inaccessible for some patients due to cost and availability. Our prior study demonstrated HXZQ + 5HT3RAs + dexamethasone's superior efficacy; this phase III trial aimed to validate this regimen. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase III trial (10 hospitals, Southwest China; March 2023-August 2024) assigned patients to group HX (HXZQ + 5HT3RA + dexamethasone) or group C (control). Primary endpoints: mean No CINV Days (NCDs) during the full cycle and complete control (CC) rate beyond the risk period. Secondary endpoints: safety, CC rate during the risk period, mean no nausea days and life function. A total of 166 patients were enrolled and 139 patients completed the study, 73 in group HX and 66 in group C. The mean NCDs was significantly better in group HX (17.92 ± 4.06) than that in group C (15.26 ± 5.91, P = .002). Group HX showed better NCDs in acute, delayed and the period beyond the risk phases than group C, with a higher CC rate of CINV beyond the risk phase (80.8% vs 60.6%, P = .009). The mean no nausea days in group HX was significantly better than that in group C (18.26 vs 15.45, P = .001). Group HX also showed a trend to better functional living index-emesis score, but only achieved the significance during the period beyond the risk phase. HXZQ in combination with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is safe and feasible for preventing CINV due to 3-day cisplatin-containing HEC throughout the whole cycle.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465996,Comparison of efficacy between transforaminal and interlaminar endoscopic discectomy for single-level lumbar disc herniation.,"This retrospective study compared the efficacy of transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TELD) and interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy (IELD) for single-level L4-L5 lumbar disc herniation. A total of 208 patients were included, with 101 undergoing TELD and 107 undergoing IELD between August 2022 and August 2024. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. Perioperative analysis showed that TELD required a longer operative time and more intraoperative fluoroscopic exposures than IELD, whereas hospital stay and complication rates were similar. At 12-month follow-up, both techniques achieved significant improvements in visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index scores relative to baseline. However, IELD yielded lower residual pain and better functional recovery, reflected by significantly lower final visual analogue scale and Oswestry disability index scores compared with TELD. These findings suggest that both procedures are safe and effective for L4-L5 lumbar disc herniation, but IELD may provide greater surgical efficiency and superior long-term functional outcomes, emphasizing the importance of anatomy-guided approach selection.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465992,A retrospective analysis of BMI/TP ratio and its predictive role in gestational hypertension outcomes.,"Nutritional status and protein metabolism play key roles in maternal adaptation to pregnancy and may influence outcomes in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The body mass index to total protein (BMI/TP) ratio may capture the balance between adiposity and protein reserves. This retrospective study included 306 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational hypertension at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China, between January 2022 and December 2023. Participants were stratified into high and low BMI/TP groups based on a threshold of 0.5. Clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters were compared between groups. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to evaluate the association between the BMI/TP ratio and pregnancy survival, adjusting for relevant covariates. Subgroup analyses assessed potential effect modification by age, obesity, and comorbidities. Among 306 pregnant women (mean age = 31.8 ± 5.6 years), those with higher BMI/TP ratios exhibited significantly greater BMI, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and total protein levels (all P < .05). Restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated a nonlinear, U-shaped association between BMI/TP ratio and pregnancy survival (P for nonlinearity < .01). Both low (<0.4) and high (>0.5) BMI/TP ratios were associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, whereas moderate ratios (approximately 0.4-0.5) showed the lowest mortality risk. These associations remained significant in multivariable Cox regression (hazard ratio = 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.57, P < .001) and were consistent across subgroups defined by obesity, maternal age ≥35 years, and comorbid disease. The BMI/TP ratio is a simple and cost-effective biomarker that reflects the balance between maternal metabolic and nutritional status. It demonstrates a nonlinear, U-shaped association with pregnancy survival in gestational hypertension, indicating that both nutritional deficiency and metabolic excess may contribute to adverse outcomes. This ratio may serve as a useful prognostic indicator for individualized risk assessment and clinical management in hypertensive pregnancies.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465991,"Giant cysts, no incisions: Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy in the elderly.","Ultrasound (US)-guided sclerotherapy is effective for hepatic and renal cysts, but data on giant cysts are limited, especially in elderly patients prone to recurrence. This study assessed the efficacy of US-guided tube drainage with medical anhydrous ethanol in treating giant hepatic and renal cysts. In this dual-center retrospective study, 55 patients with giant hepatic or renal cysts underwent US-guided percutaneous tube drainage and ethanol sclerotherapy in Zhejiang Hospital and Lijiang People's Hospital from February 2023 to February 2024. Clinical outcomes and adverse events were analyzed. Potential confounders were addressed through strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, standardized procedures, and multivariate adjustment. One year after surgery, efficacy was comparable between the ethanol flushing and flushing-retention methods. For the cyst volume reduction rate (VRR) at 3 months post-surgery, cyst type (β = 0.113, P < .001), treatment method (β = -0.060, P = .018), and maximum diameter (β = -0.009, P = .019) were independent influencing factors. Furthermore, age (β = 0.004, P = .023) and treatment method (β = -0.095, P = .014) were independent predictors of VRR at 1 year postoperatively. Maximum cyst diameter was the only independent factor influencing recurrence (OR = 1.35, P = .009). US-guided tube drainage and sclerotherapy with medical anhydrous ethanol is an effective, minimally invasive option for giant hepatic and renal cysts, offering a valuable strategy for elderly patients.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465985,Comprehensive evidence mapping of Chinese medicine for the treatment of pulmonary heart disease: A systematic assessment of efficacy and challenges.,"This study aims to assess the quality of evidence regarding the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) interventions in pulmonary heart disease (PHD) through a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant literature. A comprehensive search was performed across both Chinese and English databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, covering studies published up to April 2024. Eligible studies on TCM interventions for cor pulmonale were included. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool. An evidence map was constructed to visualize key characteristics such as study population, sample size, and intervention modalities. A total of 39 studies were included, comprising systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and network meta-analyses on TCM interventions for PHD. The most common interventions were TCM injections, followed by decoctions and proprietary Chinese medicines. Treatment strategies primarily involved blood activation, tonification, blood stasis resolution, and meridian dredging (Tongluo). The AMSTAR 2 assessments identified several methodological weaknesses, including lack of protocol registration, absence of a list of excluded studies, and insufficient analysis of heterogeneity and risk of bias. According to the evidence map, 36 studies reported beneficial effects and 3 indicated likely benefit, suggesting a potentially positive role of TCM in managing PHD. While most studies suggest that TCM interventions may be beneficial for PHD, the overall methodological quality of the evidence is very low. Therefore, the findings should be interpreted with caution. TCM shows promise as a therapeutic option for PHD; however, high-quality systematic reviews are needed to validate these preliminary results.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465977,Rituximab for refractory minimal change disease: Long-term outcomes in the remission maintenance phase.,"Minimal change disease (MCD) has a high recurrence rate, with refractory MCD frequently requiring long-term corticosteroid therapy or combination regimens with other immunosuppressive agents. Rituximab (RTX) has been confirmed to be an effective treatment for refractory MCD. However, its role in remission maintenance remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess RTX dosing strategies, infusion intervals, and relapse predictors during the remission maintenance phase of refractory MCD. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 14 patients with refractory MCD who had achieved complete remission with corticosteroids or conventional immunosuppressants and subsequently received RTX during the maintenance phase. The mean follow-up period was 31.1 ± 9.6 months. RTX was administered intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m2 body surface area or 1000 mg every infusion. Based on their laboratory results, RTX therapy was administered in the patients intermittently. Patients who experienced recurrence were withdrawn from the study for further observation and management. Patients were treated with RTX at 375 mg/m2 body surface area or 1000 mg with each infusion in the remission maintenance phase. The mean intervals from the first to second and from the second to third infusions were 7.9 ± 2.1 months and 11.8 ± 2.8 months, respectively. Eight patients remained in remission and 6 patients experienced a relapse. Steroids or immunosuppressants were discontinued in 12 patients, while a dose reduction was achieved in 2 others. The relapse frequency significantly decreased from 1.87 (0.43-2.69) to 0 (0.00-1.33; P < .05). Recurrence was negatively associated with additional annual RTX therapy (P < .05). Serious side effects were not found. RTX is associated with reduced relapse frequency and earlier discontinuation of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in refractory MCD patients during remission maintenance. Additional annual RTX administration represents an effective strategy for decreasing disease recurrence. Our findings suggest potential benefit of early administration. While findings are promising, larger controlled studies are necessary to establish optimal dosing intervals and long-term efficacy.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465969,Oral Chinese patent medicines for herpangina in children: A network meta-analysis.,"Herpangina, primarily caused by Enterovirus A71 and Coxsackievirus A, is characterized by fever, oropharyngeal pain, and ulcers. The prognosis is generally favorable. However, some severe cases may lead to complications such as febrile seizures and myocarditis. In recent years, clinical studies have demonstrated that combining oral Chinese patent medicines with conventional Western medicine can improve treatment efficacy. To compare the efficacy and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines combined with conventional treatment for pediatric herpangina using network meta-analysis. We systematically searched major Chinese and international databases from inception to January 1, 2024. Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (Cochrane tool). Statistical analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 and Review Manager 5.3 software. A network meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The odds ratio, and its 95% confidence interval (CI), were used as the effect measure for binary outcomes. The mean difference (MD), and its 95% CI, were used as the effect measure for continuous variables. Differences in efficacy and safety among interventions were compared and ranked independently. 11 oral Chinese patent medicines, 61 studies, and 6805 patients were included. The antipyretic time was ranked from best to worst as XiaoerShuangjinqingre Oral Liquid (SJQR), Lianhuaqingwen Granules (LHQW), Pudilan Anti-inflammatory Oral Liquid (PDL), XiaoerNiuhuangqingxin Powder (NHQX), Lanqin Oral Liquid (LQ), XiaoerQingyan Granules (QY), Shuanghuanglian Oral Liquid (SHL), XiaoerChaiguituire Granule (CGTR), XiaoerChiqiaoqingre Granules (CQQR), Kouyanqing Granules (KYQ), and Shufengjiedu Capsules (SFJD). The herpes regression time was ranked from best to worst as SJQR, KYQ, PDL, CQQR, SHL, NHQX, LHQW, LQ, QY, SFJD, and CGTR. The incidence of adverse reactions was ranked from lowest to highest as CQQR, PDL, LQ, CGTR, LHQW, NHQX, SJQR. Combining oral Chinese patent medicines with conventional treatment effectively shortens the time of fever and herpes in children. Additionally, no increase in adverse events was observed in terms of safety when oral Chinese patent medicines were combined with conventional treatment.

41465965,Aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin alone in patients with mild-to-moderate stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Studies have shown that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is superior to aspirin monotherapy in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attacks. However, there is limited evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of DAPT in mild-to-moderate stroke. PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception till March 2024 for published randomized controlled trials and observational studies that compared aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate stroke. R version 4.3.2 was used to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). A total of 4 studies reporting data for 15,173 patients were included. DAPT was associated with a non-significant trend of reduced risk of early neurological deterioration (END) (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.28-1.05, P = .07) and recurrent ischemic stroke (RR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.41-1.04, P = .07). The risk of recurrent hemorrhagic stroke (RR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.47-1.86, P = .86), all-cause death (RR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.52-1.08), or myocardial infarction (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.45-1.54) was comparable across the two groups. DAPT was not associated with an increased risk of any bleeding event (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.36-1.36). DAPT demonstrated a non-significant trend toward reduced risk of END and recurrent ischemic stroke without increasing the risk of bleeding events compared to aspirin monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate stroke. Further large-scale trials are needed to confirm these potential benefits.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465964,Analysis of factors affecting the efficacy of contralateral seventh cervical nerve transfer for central upper limb paralysis and prediction model for efficacy evaluation.,"This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and predictors of contralateral C7 nerve transfer (CC7) for central upper limb spastic hemiplegia and develop a preoperative prediction model. A retrospective analysis included 58 stroke patients with spastic hemiplegia undergoing CC7 surgery. Composite efficacy endpoints assessed efficacy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified predictive factors. A nomogram prediction model was built and validated using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. CC7 significantly improved affected upper limb function. The Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE) score increased from 25.9 ± 3.6 preoperatively to 37.6 ± 3.4 at final follow-up (P < .001). Based on composite endpoints, the overall efficacy rate was 60.3% (35/58). Analysis of 15 potential factors identified 2 significant independent predictors of efficacy: younger age (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.96, P = .006) and higher baseline FMA-UE score (odds ratio = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.12-1.89, P = .005). A nomogram incorporating these factors demonstrated strong diagnostic performance (area under the curve = 0.898, 95% CI: 0.820-0.976, P < .05). Bootstrap validation (area under the curve = 0.884), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis confirmed the model's robustness and clinical utility. CC7 showed good safety; postoperative adverse reactions (transient contralateral limb numbness/pain) were mild and resolved without long-term issues. CC7 is a safe and effective treatment for central hemiplegia, significantly improving upper limb function. The developed nomogram, using age and baseline FMA-UE score, provides an accurate tool for predicting CC7 efficacy and aiding patient selection.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement

A retrospective analysis was performed on 120 elderly patients with single-segment degenerative LSS treated from January 2020 to January 2024. Fifty-seven underwent percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy group, and 63 underwent percutaneous large-channel spinal endoscopic decompression (large-channel group). Surgical indicators, complications, stress response, lumbar and leg pain, lumbar function [Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score], and lumbar stability were compared. The large-channel group had shorter operative time and fewer intraoperative fluoroscopy sessions than the percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy group (P<.05), while intraoperative blood loss and incision length were greater (P<.05). Hospital stay and complication rates showed no difference (P>.05). At 3 days postoperatively, serum NE, DA, and 5-HT levels were elevated in both groups (P<.05) but were lower in the large-channel group (P<.05). Lumbar and leg visual analogue scale scores at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months were lower than preoperative values in both groups (P<.05), with greater improvement in the large-channel group at 3 and 6 months (P<.05). At 1, 3, and 6 months, JOA scores increased and ODI scores decreased in both groups (P<.05). At 3 and 6 months, JOA scores were higher and ODI scores lower in the large-channel group (P<.05). At 6 months, lumbar curvature, lordosis angle, pelvic tilt, and intervertebral space height improved in both groups (P<.05), with greater gains in the large-channel group (P<.05). Percutaneous large-channel spinal endoscopic decompression for elderly patients with single-segment degenerative LSS can shorten operative time, alleviate stenosis and stress response, improve function, and enhance lumbar stability.

41465938,One case of percutaneous lung biopsy assisted by artificial pneumothorax technique and literature review.,"Early lung cancer diagnosis is crucial for prognosis, but elderly patients with comorbidities poorly tolerate invasive procedures. Conventional percutaneous biopsy for major vessel-adjacent high-risk nodules has a mere 60% to 70% success rate and high complications, while artificial pneumothorax boosts it to 85% to 90%. This case verifies the technique's safety in this population. A 72-year-old female had a 7-mm left lung ground-glass nodule (2021, no intervention). Follow-up computed tomography (CT) (November 2024) showed the nodule enlarged to 10 × 10 mm with a new 18 × 17 mm irregular consolidation. Empirical anti-infection failed; the lesion was adjacent to the aortic arch and heart, so artificial pneumothorax-assisted CT-guided biopsy was adopted. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery confirmed stage IA1 (tumor, node, metastasis stage T1aN0M0) lung adenocarcinoma (lepidic-predominant + invasive mucinous subtypes), with negative margins and no vascular, nerve, or pleural invasion. CT-guided artificial pneumothorax-assisted percutaneous lung biopsy, followed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery left upper lobectomy plus lymph node dissection. Vital signs were stable; drainage tube removed on day 4 post-biopsy. One-month follow-up: no hemoptysis, chest pain, or pneumothorax; CT showed no intrapulmonary exudation. The technique is safe for lesions adjacent to the heart and major vessels.

We aimed to explore the feasibility of using pupillary pain index (PPI) to evaluate the analgesic effect of ISB in patients undergoing ARCR under sevoflurane anesthesia. This prospective, observational, single-center study took place between October 26, 2022, and October 11, 2023. We included 34 adult patients scheduled for ARCR under combined ipsilateral ISB and sevoflurane anesthesia. Prior to surgery, a single-shot unilateral ISB was performed under ultrasound guidance using a 15 mL mixture containing 7.5 mL of 2% lidocaine and 7.5 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine. PPI was measured twice for each patient: first, after the induction of general anesthesia, and second, at the end of surgery, with a standard stimulus applied to both the ISB and control sides of the C5 and C6 dermatomal level of patient's shoulder region. The primary endpoint was the difference in PPI between the ISB and control sides, and the secondary endpoint was the correlation between postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) and PPI on the ISB side. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that on the initial PPI measurement, the PPI on the ISB side was significantly lower than that on the control side (Median: 1.5 vs 7, P < .001). Similar results were observed for the second PPI measurement, with the PPI on the ISB side significantly lower than that on the control side (Median: 1 vs 6, P < .001). There was a moderate, positive relationship between the postoperative NRS and the PPI on the ISB side at the end of surgery, indicated by a Spearman coefficient of 0.39 (P = .022). At an age-adjusted MAC of 0.3 for sevoflurane, a significant difference was observed between the PPIs on the blocked and unblocked sides. The PPI exhibits potential as an objective tool for measuring the analgesic efficacy of ISB in patients undergoing ARCR under sevoflurane anesthesia.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ME-BLI in diagnosing early gastric neoplastic lesions. From July 2022 to June 2024, 288 patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University were enrolled. All participants underwent conventional white-light endoscopy followed by ME-BLI examination and targeted biopsy. Pathological results identified 21 cases as early gastric cancer (GC) and 67 as non-early GC. Comparative analysis revealed that the presence of a demarcation line (DL), irregular microvessels (MV), and irregular microsurface structure (MS) was significantly more frequent in the early GC group than in the non-early GC group (all P < .001). The combination of DL, MV, and MS demonstrated high diagnostic performance for early GC, with an area under the curve of 0.875. In conclusion, ME-BLI is a valuable tool for the diagnosis of early GC, and the combined assessment of DL, MV, and MS provides an objective, user-friendly, and reproducible approach.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465916,Comparative efficacy of immediate implant placement and alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The reduction in extraction socket volume resulting from spontaneous healing poses challenges for dental implant placement. This systematic review aims to evaluate and compare the multifaceted performance of immediate implant placement (IIP) and alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) in terms of changes in soft and hard tissues of the alveolar ridge, implant failure, postoperative complications, and patient-reported satisfaction following tooth extraction. An electronic search was conducted utilizing the databases of MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the comparisons of IIP and ARP protocols. The primary outcome variables included marginal bone level (MBL), pink esthetic score (PES), and implant failure; secondary outcome variables included postoperative complications, horizontal width change, facial gingival margin change, and patient-reported satisfaction. The Cochrane RoB2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias in RCTs. Weighted or mean differences (MD), odds ratio (OR), and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. The protocol followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statements and was prospectively registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024503989). Eleven RCTs were included, involving 353 patients in the IIP group and 348 patients in the ARP group. Regarding MBL, the IIP protocol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in both non-molar (MD = -0.36 mm, 95% CI = -0.64 to 0.07]) and molar regions (MD = -0.41 mm, 95% CI = -0.49 to -0.32]) compared to ARP; however, no statistical differences were observed regarding PES (MD = -0.05, 95% CI = -0.52 to 0.43) or implant failure (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 0.98 to 4.44). Furthermore, both groups achieved similar outcomes in terms of horizontal width change, facial gingival margin change, and patient-reported satisfaction (P > .05), except for a higher incidence of postoperative complications observed in the IIP group (p < 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, the IIP protocol can achieve comparable esthetic outcomes and implant success as the ARP protocol; however, there may be a higher incidence of postoperative complications and MBL alterations. Further long-term and well-conducted RCTs are warranted to validate the efficacy of these protocols.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41465911,Efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine injections for older adults with community-acquired pneumonia: An evidence map.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common respiratory condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. Older adults are disproportionately affected, experiencing higher risks and poorer outcomes. The current evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMIs) for CAP in older adults is limited. This study aims to synthesize high-quality evidence and identify gaps in the existing literature to guide future research. A systematic search was conducted in eight databases - PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and SinoMed - covering records from database inception to December 19, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses (MAs) assessing the use of TCMIs for older adults with CAP were included. The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Evidence bubble plots were created to visualize the study characteristics and distribution of evidence. The evidence map included 165 RCTs and one MAs, with the earliest publication dating from 2001. All studies were conducted in China, and RCTs accounted for 99% of the included evidence. Tanreqing Injection was the most frequently investigated intervention, with a median treatment duration of 7 to 13 days. The primary outcomes were the clinical effective rate and time to symptom resolution. Both the RCTs and the MAs reported significant benefits of TCMIs for older adults with CAP. However, the overall certainty of the evidence remains low. TCMIs show substantial potential for improving clinical efficacy and alleviating symptoms in older adults with CAP. However, existing studies have design and methodological limitations. Future research should focus on improving methodological quality to enhance the robustness of the clinical evidence.",2025,Medicine,L1_scientific_engagement

41465800,Impact of Periodontal Host-Modulation Therapies on Oral-Gut Microbiome Axis in Periodontitis Patients with Hematological Diseases: A Narrative Review.,"Host-modulating therapies and oral microbiome-targeted approaches are emerging options in periodontal care and are especially relevant for patients undergoing immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Immune dysregulation induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors or CAR-T cell therapy may worsen periodontal inflammation and alter the composition and functions of the oral microbiota. Beyond these, other immunomodulatory treatments commonly employed in hematologic malignancies-including monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab, daratumumab), immunomodulatory drugs (e.g., lenalidomide, thalidomide), cytokine-based therapies (e.g., interferon-α), and targeted small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., BTK inhibitors, JAK inhibitors) may also influence periodontal homeostasis and oral microbial ecology by altering neutrophil function, cytokine profiles, and mucosal immune surveillance. The oral microbiota is functionally connected with the intestinal microbial ecosystem through the oral-gut axis, by periodontal pathogens may colonize the gut and modulate systemic immune responses, with potential repercussions on the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy. This narrative review examines the mechanisms and clinical applicability of host-modulating therapies, including subantimicrobial-dose doxycycline, omega-3 fatty acids, and microbiome-targeted interventions, such as oral probiotics, prebiotics and other antimicrobials in patients treated with immunotherapy.",2025,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an enzyme regulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) degradation, has been implicated in AD through mechanisms involving amyloid-β (Aβ) processing, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic dysfunction. This review aimed to evaluate clinical, genetic, and experimental evidence regarding the role of PCSK9 in AD and its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar (2020-2025) using predefined terms related to PCSK9 and Alzheimer's disease. Eligible studies included clinical, in vivo, and in vitro investigations reporting PCSK9 expression, regulation, or inhibition in relation to AD pathology. Due to methodological heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was performed. Forty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Preclinical findings consistently showed that elevated PCSK9 may indirectly promote Aβ accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline, while genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 mitigates these effects. Clinical evidence was variable: several studies identified increased PCSK9 levels in cerebrospinal fluid or brain tissue of AD patients, often correlating with tau markers, but large-scale genetic and Mendelian randomization studies did not confirm a causal association. PCSK9 inhibitors, widely used in cardiovascular therapy, demonstrated potent LDL-C reduction without cognitive adverse effects. Experimental data suggest that PCSK9 contributes to AD-related pathology, whereas human evidence indicates a modulatory or biomarker role rather than a causative one. Despite strong preclinical data, human genetics lacks causal evidence for PCSK9 in Alzheimer's. It may be a disease modifier or biomarker; its clinical relevance requires confirmation through longitudinal studies and CNS-penetrant therapies.",2025,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial; however, current methods lack sufficient sensitivity. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (uKIM-1) for AKI in neonates by quantifying differences in uKIM-1 levels between AKI and non-AKI neonates. We systematically searched major databases for comparative studies. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. A random-effects meta-analysis estimated the pooled Hedges' g in uKIM-1 levels, accounting for heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses explored sources of heterogeneity (continent, study design, sampling time, AKI definition).

41465765,Intracavernosal Botulinum Toxin Injection for Erectile Dysfunction: A Comprehensive Systematic Review.,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects approximately 20% of men worldwide, significantly affecting their quality of life. While phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) are the standard first-line treatment, a substantial number of patients are non-responders. Second-line treatments, such as intracavernosal alprostadil, are effective but often limited by their invasive nature and the need for frequent injections. Intracavernosal onabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) offers a promising new option. By inhibiting acetylcholine release and norepinephrine, as well as other neurotransmitters involved in detumescence, it facilitates cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation and enhances penile blood flow. Its effects may persist for up to six months following a single injection, potentially reducing treatment burden and improving adherence among men with refractory ED. A systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Clinicaltrials.gov from inception until August 2025 using a combination of keywords and MeSH terms related to 'erectile dysfunction' and 'botulinum toxin'. After screening, 51 studies met the inclusion criteria. Due to significant heterogeneity in interventions (e.g., BoNT-A dosage, co-therapies), patient populations, and reported outcomes, the data were not suitable for meta-analysis. Consequently, a narrative synthesis was performed to summarize the findings. Among the included studies, intracavernosal BoNT-A was associated with improvements in validated erectile function scores. Reported response rates, variably defined across studies, ranged from 40% to 77.5%. Several studies suggested that efficacy was higher in patients with mild-to-moderate ED and with repeated administration of 100 U doses. The treatment exhibited a favorable safety profile. The most common adverse event was mild, transient penile pain (reported incidence 1.5-6%). No studies reported serious systemic adverse events. The overall strength of the evidence was limited by significant heterogeneity among the included studies and their generally small sample sizes. Based on this systematic review, intracavernosal onabotulinumtoxinA (BoNT-A) may be a beneficial therapeutic option for patients with refractory ED, offering potential improvements in sexual function while reducing the need for invasive therapies. Future large-scale, placebo-controlled studies are essential to confirm these benefits and standardize their clinical application.",2025,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41465728,SGLT2 Inhibitors and Liver Cirrhosis: Hype or Hope?,"Liver cirrhosis is marked by sodium and water retention, portal hypertension and sharply reduced survival after decompensation. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) induce insulin-independent glycosuria and natriuresis and have proven cardio-renal benefits, prompting interest in their role as adjuncts for ascites. This review synthesizes current evidence on efficacy, safety and mechanistic plausibility of SGLT2i in cirrhosis. Observational cohorts and case series suggest that adding SGLT2i to standard diuretics increases natriuresis, lowers ascites burden and paracentesis requirements, improves weight and aminotransferases and may reduce hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma risk. Safety remains paramount: hypotension, acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome-related acute kidney injury, genitourinary infections, electrolyte disturbances and rare euglycemic ketoacidosis necessitate careful patient selection, slow titration and close monitoring, especially in decompensated disease and when combined with loop diuretics or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Overall, the balance of data supports cautious optimism: SGLT2i represent a promising adjunct within protocolized care pathways for selected patients, while definitive trials powered for hepatic outcomes are still required to clarify indications, timing, dosing and long-term impact.",2025,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

41465589,The Role of miRNAs in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Over the years, there has been extensive research conducted on Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder known for causing motor impairment and behavioral changes. In more recent years, the roles of dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) in PD pathology have been studied in the hopes of developing new diagnostic methods or even treatments. This systematic review pinpoints and examines studies between 2010 and 2024 that have identified significant dysregulation of miRNAs in patients with PD. Upon filtering out the search results by a series of exclusion criteria, this review was conducted using 56 relevant studies. These studies revealed a vast array of significantly dysregulated miRNAs identified in the samples of patients with PD, when compared to healthy controls. A number of these miRNAs, such as miR-29c-3p, are likely biomarkers for more accurate PD diagnosis, and many, such as miR-485-3p, were found to be involved in PD pathogenesis. With further research, miRNAs could become a helpful diagnostic and prognostic tool for PD, with some of them even being candidate therapeutic targets for future treatments.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465586,"Glioblastoma-A Contemporary Overview of Epidemiology, Classification, Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment: A Review Article.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for about half of all gliomas in adults. Despite intensive research and advances in molecular biology, genomics, and modern neuroimaging techniques, the prognosis for patients with GBM remains extremely poor. Despite the implementation of multimodal treatment involving surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, the average survival time of patients is only about 15 months. This is primarily due to the complex biology of this cancer, which involves numerous genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, as well as a highly heterogeneous tumor structure and the presence of glioblastoma stem cells with self renewal capacity. Mutations and abnormalities in genes such as IDH-wt, EGFR, PTEN, TP53, TERT, and CDKN2A/B are crucial in the pathogenesis of GBM. In particular, IDH-wt status (wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase) is one of the most important identification markers distinguishing GBM from other, more favorable gliomas with IDH mutations. Frequent EGFR amplifications and TERT gene promoter mutations lead to the deregulation of tumor cell proliferation and increased aggressiveness. In turn, the loss of function of suppressor genes such as PTEN or CDKN2A/B promotes uncontrolled cell growth and tumor progression. The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment also plays an important role, promoting immune escape and weakening the effectiveness of systemic therapies, including immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the epidemiology, classification, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, as well as to discuss the impact of recent advances in molecular and imaging diagnostics on clinical decision-making. A comprehensive review of recent literature (2018-2025) was conducted, focusing on WHO CNS5 classification updates, novel biomarkers (IDH, TERT, MGMT, EGFR), and modern diagnostic techniques such as liquid biopsy, radiogenomics, and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The results of the review indicate that the introduction of integrated histo-molecular diagnostics in the WHO 2021 classification has significantly increased diagnostic precision, enabling better prognostic and therapeutic stratification of patients. Modern imaging techniques, such as advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and radiomics and radiogenomics tools, allow for more precise assessment of tumor characteristics, prediction of response to therapy, and monitoring of disease progression. Contemporary molecular techniques, including DNA methylation profiling and NGS, enable in-depth genomic and epigenetic analysis, which translates into a more personalized approach to treatment. Despite the use of multimodal therapy, which is based on maximum safe tumor resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy, recurrence is almost inevitable. GBM shows a high degree of resistance to treatment, which results from the presence of stem cell subpopulations, dynamic clonal evolution, and the ability to adapt to unfavorable microenvironmental conditions. Promising preclinical and early clinical results show new therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T therapies), oncolytic virotherapy, and Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) technology. Although these methods show potential for prolonging survival, their clinical efficacy still needs to be confirmed in large studies. The role of artificial intelligence in the analysis of imaging and molecular data is also increasingly being emphasized, which may contribute to the development of more accurate predictive models and therapeutic decisions. Despite these advancements, GBM remains a major therapeutic challenge due to its high heterogeneity and treatment resistance. The integration of molecular diagnostics, artificial intelligence, and personalized therapeutic strategies that may enhance survival and quality of life for GBM patients.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465577,Clinical Insights into Mesenchymal Stem Cell Applications for Spinal Cord Injury.,"This review examines the safety and clinical efficacy of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs)-based therapies in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The review highlights the methodology of trials, the source of MSCs, the dosage of cells administered, transplantation methods, patient inclusion criteria, and the methods of evaluating the effectiveness of the therapy. MSC transplantation in SCI was safe and feasible in all the studies summarized in our review. All studies conducted have demonstrated varying degrees of patient improvement and reduction in the severity of neurological deficits. However, further controlled randomized studies on larger numbers of patients are needed to better evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MS transplantation. The prospects of the enhancement of the efficacy of the SCI cell therapy with MSCs, including their transplantation with other types of stem cells, administration of MSC-derived exosomes, genetic modification of MSCs, use of the MSC- and other-stem-cell-based tissue-engineered scaffolds, and combination of cell therapy with neuromodulation, are discussed.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465572,"Sarcopenia in the Aging Process: Pathophysiological Mechanisms, Clinical Implications, and Emerging Therapeutic Approaches.","In the face of population aging, sarcopenia has emerged as a significant muscle disorder characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to sarcopenia and help explain its association with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive research, there remains a need to integrate current knowledge on interventions that target these interconnected mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent evidence on the effects of resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation (high-protein intake, leucine, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids), and probiotic use on muscle function and inflammatory status in older adults with sarcopenia. Literature was critically analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent strategies. The reviewed studies consistently report that combining resistance training with anti-inflammatory nutrition and targeted supplementation improves muscle strength, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and supports mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that an integrated, multicomponent approach represents a promising strategy for attenuating the progression of sarcopenia and reducing its associated comorbidities.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465549,Immunopathogenic Mechanisms in Connective Tissue Disease-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease: Incessant Loop of Immunity to Fibrosis.,"Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD) represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by the progressive convergence of chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and fibrotic remodeling in the lung parenchyma. While often conceptualized through a model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), CTD-ILD is fundamentally an immune-driven pathology with distinct inflammatory mechanisms in which adaptive immunity plays a profound role. This narrative review explores the ""inflammation-immunity-fibrosis continuum"" in CTD-ILD, elaborating the intricate cellular and molecular pathways that distinguish it from IPF. We highlight the central role of persistent T-cell responses and B-cell dysregulation, which often occur within organized tertiary lymphoid structures in the lung. This review examines how these immune processes are propagated by multiple cytokine pathways, including the TGF-β/SMAD, JAK/STAT, and phosphodiesterase-4 signaling pathways, which serve as crucial links between inflammation and fibrosis. This distinct immune mechanism in CTD-ILD explains why immunomodulatory agents are a cornerstone of CTD-ILD treatment, in contrast to their limited efficacy in IPF, and emphasizes the current paradigm of combining immunosuppression with antifibrotic drugs to target the dual drivers of the disease.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465539,How Laboratory Guidelines Promote the Validity of Circulating Extracellular Vesicle-Associated Nucleic Acid Biomarker Signatures in Liquid Biopsy.,"Circulating nucleic acids, particularly those associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs), represent a promising class of molecular biomarkers in liquid biopsy for 'non-invasive' disease diagnostics, for better prognosis, and for therapeutic monitoring. However, the translation of this new circulating biomarker source into clinical practice is mostly hindered by methodological variability and a lack of standardization across the analytical workflow. This article highlights the implementation of international academic guidelines, such as Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) and Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV), in the entire analytical procedure in promoting the integrity, reproducibility, and validity of EV-associated nucleic acid markers in molecular diagnostics. By standardizing the liquid biopsy workflow from tissue sampling up to data analysis and statistics, these established guidelines lay the necessary scientific basis for a robust, reproducible, reliable, and valid RNA and DNA biomarker discovery in EVs. The ultimate goal is the successful implementation of the developed biomarker signature into the clinical diagnostic routine, but this requires further rounds of rigorous validation. The regularly updated guidelines should not be seen as optional recommendations, but more like an essential pillars of scientific rigor and standardization in order to achieve better and biological meaningful biomarker results in liquid biopsy.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465487,iNOS in Macrophage Polarization: Pharmacological and Regulatory Insights.,"Macrophages play a central role in orchestrating inflammation and immune responses, with their polarization states (M1 or M2) exhibiting both pro- and anti-inflammatory, as well as anti-cancer functions. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a pivotal role in immune regulation through its impact on macrophage polarization. As a hallmark of M1 macrophages, iNOS drives pro-inflammatory responses, while its suppression favors anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. This dual role as both a biomarker and regulatory hub positions iNOS as a promising therapeutic target across diverse disease states. This review examines the roles of iNOS modulation in macrophage polarization across various disease models. Both synthetic and natural iNOS regulators have been shown to modulate iNOS activity, thereby reprogramming macrophages toward either inflammatory or reparative phenotypes. We categorize these regulators into those that directly inhibit enzymatic activity and those that indirectly modulate through signaling pathways. Additionally, recent preclinical and clinical studies on iNOS inhibitors are summarized, highlighting their therapeutic potential in inflammatory, metabolic, and oncologic diseases. Taken together, the evidence underscores the therapeutic relevance of iNOS regulation as a strategy to reprogram macrophage plasticity in disease-specific immune microenvironments.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

Current therapies are often limited by adverse effects and insufficient long-term efficacy, highlighting the need for more comprehensive therapeutic approaches. Berberine (BRB), a plant-derived isoquinoline alkaloid, has attracted growing attention due to its pleiotropic immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and gut-homeostasis-modulating properties, which involve reshaping the gut microbiota and underscore its therapeutic relevance within the gut-microbiome-brain axis. The aim of this review is to synthesize current scientific evidence regarding the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of BRB in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We compare its activity with first-line therapies and discuss its impact on microbial composition, including the bidirectional regulation of specific bacterial taxa relevant to intestinal and systemic disorders that originate in the gut. Furthermore, we emphasize that gut bacteria convert BRB into bioactive metabolites, contributing to its enhanced intraluminal activity despite its low systemic bioavailability. By integrating molecular and microbiological evidence, this review fills a critical knowledge gap regarding the comprehensive therapeutic potential of BRB as a promising candidate for future IBD interventions. The novelty of this work lies in unifying fragmented findings into a framework that explains how BRB acts simultaneously at the levels of host immunity, microbial ecology, and neuroimmune communication-thus offering a new conceptual model for its role within the gut-microbiome-brain axis.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

A narrative review was conducted using a systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2000 and 2025 on biomarkers in intellectual disability and neurodegenerative diseases. Peer-reviewed articles in English or Persian were included, and the extracted data were synthesized thematically. Findings show that various biomarkers, including protein biomarkers (such as Aβ and tau), imaging (such as PET and MRI), genetic biomarkers, and fluid-based (blood and CSF) biomarkers, have significant potential in early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating treatment response. However, the use of these biomarkers in the population with intellectual disabilities faces unique challenges, including inherent biological heterogeneity, the presence of comorbidities, methodological barriers in assessment, and complex ethical considerations. The final conclusion indicates that achieving the maximum potential of these biomarkers requires the development of standardized and validated protocols for this specific population, conducting further longitudinal studies, and seriously considering ethical issues.

Mitochondrial dysfunction accelerates severe iBRB disruption, a process which is increasingly implicated in a cascade of mitochondrial pathologies including mitochondrial DNA destabilization, oxidative stress, calcium homeostasis disruption, mitochondrial autophagy deficiency, and dysregulated dynamic regulation. This review establishes the iBRB as a crossroads for metabolic, redox, and inflammatory signaling. By analyzing evidence from diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion models, we clarify how mitochondrial decline translates local energy deficiency into chronic barrier dysfunction. We posit that restoring mitochondrial function is indispensable for vascular resilience and regeneration, a conclusion drawn from integrating molecular, cellular, and translational findings.

Using platforms based on nanoscale, researchers have been able to manipulate immune responses operating across spatial and temporal scales to address key limitations of conventional immunotherapy associated with working with immune response such as immune evasion, systemic toxicity, and poor pharmacokinetics. Sophisticated nanoparticles (such as stimuli-sensitive ones, exosome-mimetic vesicle nanoparticles, and nanoparticles with CRISPR) allow directed immunomodulators, antigens, and gene-editing systems to reach one or more particular immune compartments. The innovations allow reprogramming of immune cells, immune tolerance rejuvenation, and expansion of antitumor immunity without significant off-target effects. Finding applications in integrating the artificial intelligence as well as multi-omics techniques, the process leads to personalization of the nano-immunotherapies based on patient-specific immuno-signatures.

Elevated GCF levels of oxLDL and apoB indicate enhanced vascular permeability and local oxidative modification, particularly in diabetes. Furthermore, oxLDL promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) via connecting oxidative stress with immune-mediated tissue injury. These insights establish GCF as a valuable, non-invasive biomarker for understanding the interplay between periodontal and systemic diseases.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465349,Alternative Splicing-Mediated Resistance to Antibody-Based Therapies: Mechanisms and Emerging Therapeutic Strategies.,"Antibody-based therapeutics targeting tumor surface markers have transformed cancer treatment; however, their efficacy is frequently limited by tumor escape mechanisms such as antigen loss, phenotypic switching, and heterogeneous target expression. Beyond genetic or transcriptional changes, RNA alternative splicing (AS) has emerged as a central post-transcriptional mechanism driving antigenic diversity and immune escape. This review outlines how AS-generated isoforms remodel surface antigen structure and function across key therapeutic targets-including CD/19/CD20/CD22, EGFR/HER2, VEGF, and PD-1/PD-L1-thereby promoting resistance to monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aberrant activity of splicing regulators disrupts canonical exon selection, leading to altered receptor signaling or the secretion of soluble decoy isoforms that evade immune recognition. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to counteract these processes through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated splicing correction, pharmacologic modulation of splicing regulators, and isoform-selective antibody or CAR-T designs. Collectively, understanding splicing-driven antigenic plasticity reveals an additional, dynamic layer of resistance regulation and provides a framework for developing RNA-informed precision antibody therapies designed to restore antigen expression, overcome immune escape, and enhance durable clinical responses.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

41465311,Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone (LHRH)-Targeted Treatment in Ovarian Cancer.,"Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecologic malignancies and requires more effective and targeted treatment strategies. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), receptors are expressed in approximately 80% of ovarian tumors, representing a promising target for targeted drug delivery. This narrative review aimed to explore the development and advancements of LHRH-receptor targeted therapies in ovarian cancer. A bibliographic search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The search strategy included studies on LHRH-peptide drug delivery systems and LHRH-conjugate nanosystems. Literature search covered in vitro studies, preclinical models, and ongoing clinical trials from 2000 to 2025. A total of 19 studies were included for peptide-drug delivery, and 30 studies were included for LHRH-conjugated nanosystems. Overall findings demonstrated enhanced preclinical efficacy, achieving ~50-80% tumor-growth inhibition and 2-4-fold higher cellular uptake, alongside reduced systemic toxicity. Early clinical studies, although limited, reported an overall response/disease-control rate of approximately 50%, supporting improved tumor accumulation of drugs, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and diagnostic agents. Ovarian cancer-specific therapy, targeting LHRH receptors, represents a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Further efforts in preclinical and clinical research are essential to refine personalized treatments and integrate them with a combination of therapies.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465304,Transcranial Stimulation Methods in the Treatment of MDD Patients-The Role of the Neurotrophin System.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) continues to be a primary cause of disability globally, with a significant number of patients exhibiting resistance to standard pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. In recent years, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have emerged as promising therapies for treatment-resistant MDD. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, which included all studies published over the last ten years. Eligible studies encompassed both animal models and clinical investigations. This review provides a comparative overview of transcranial electrical stimulation modalities, with a focus on their mechanisms of action, clinical efficacy, and underlying neurobiological mechanisms. We pay particular attention to the role of the neurotrophin system, specifically brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in mediating the treatment effects of transcranial stimulation. Recent findings indicate that neuromodulation could improve neuroplasticity by increasing BDNF levels and associated signaling pathways, which may help stabilize mood and enhance the improvement of individuals with MDD. A more profound understanding of these mechanisms could lead to more precise, biomarker-driven interventions. Further research is essential to elucidating the long-term effects of brain stimulation on neurotrophin levels and to creating more individualized treatment strategies.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465288,Microglial Activation in Nociplastic Pain: From Preclinical Models to PET Neuroimaging and Implications for Targeted Therapeutic Strategies.,"Nociplastic pain has recently been introduced as a third entity for identifying patients suffering from chronic pain that arises from altered nociception, without evidence of peripheral nociceptors activation or alterations of the somatosensory system. Currently, the main challenge of nociplastic pain is that it remains a diagnosis of exclusion, since no specific biomarkers are available. Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging studies, using selective translocator protein (TSPO) radiopharmaceuticals, specific for microglia activation, showed a strong correlation between neuroinflammation and nociplastic pain: in particular, in fibromyalgia (FM), which is the prototype disease. Neuroimaging studies identified key brain changes associated with pain processing and neuroinflammation in patients suffering from widespread pain, often associated with sleep, mood disorders, and cognitive impairment. The present review will provide an overview on the role of neuroinflammation in nociplastic pain, focusing on preclinical evidence of microglia activation and advances in PET neuroimaging. Understanding the role of neuroinflammation could have relevant implications in selecting targeted therapeutic strategies and improving analgesic efficacy.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

41465265,Grief-Related Psychopathology from Complicated Grief to DSM-5-TR Prolonged Grief Disorder: A Systematic Review of Biochemical Findings.,"Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is marked by enduring and disruptive grief symptoms following the death of a significant other. Although PGD has been recognized as a distinct psychopathological entity within the trauma dimension in the DSM-5-TR, its neurobiological underpinnings remain not fully defined. A systematic literature review was conducted up to September 2025 following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science were searched using a comprehensive strategy combining MeSH terms and free-text keywords. Eligible studies included human participants, validated grief assessment tools and biomarker assessments. Out of 2140 initial records, 12 studies published between 1989 and 2022 met inclusion criteria. Investigated neuro-psycho-endocrine systems included the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, catecholamines, oxytocin, endocannabinoids and immune/inflammatory markers. Key findings in pathological grief reactions included altered cortisol rhythms, elevated oxytocin levels, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune system dysregulation. Results are limited by heterogeneity in study designs, small sample sizes, inconsistent use of diagnostic criteria prior to DSM-5-TR and lack of control for psychiatric comorbidities. This review highlights emerging biological correlates of PGD, particularly those involving the stress response, reward-attachment networks and immune/inflammatory pathways. Further standardized, longitudinal research is essential to gain a more defined picture of PGD, to clarify causal mechanisms and to guide targeted therapeutic interventions.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465254,Fibrin Monomer in Thrombosis and Haemostasis: A Clinical Biomarker and Beyond.,"Fibrin monomer (FM) is a transient intermediate of blood coagulation that functions as both an active regulator of haemostasis and a sensitive biomarker for prothrombotic states. Clinically, FM is measured indirectly as its derivative, soluble fibrin monomer complexes (SFMC), which is also often referred to as FM throughout the clinical literature. FM participates in a complex regulatory network modulating thrombin generation and fibrinolysis, interacting with platelet receptors, including integrin αIIbβ3 and GPVI, and engaging GPIb-vWF interactions. This comprehensive review examines FM's molecular mechanisms in haemostatic regulation and evaluates clinical evidence for FM as a biomarker. Particular focus is placed on FM's utility for risk stratification across thrombotic conditions, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, venous thromboembolism, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Current challenges, including assay standardization and universal cut-off values, are discussed. By synthesizing mechanistic insights with clinical data, this integrated perspective may accelerate the translation of FM biology into improved risk assessment tools and novel therapeutic strategies.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465218,Pathogenesis-Guided Biomarker Assessment: A Shift in Prostate Cancer Diagnostics.,"Despite prostate cancer being one of the most common malignancies in men, its pathological diagnosis remains plagued by inter-observer variability and diagnostic ambiguity. Traditional morphological assessment and currently available biomarkers such as PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen), AMACR (Alpha methylacyl CoA racemase), and p63 suffer from poor specificity and clinical reliability. In this review, we present a pathogenesis-guided biomarker discovery strategy that led to the development of a clinically validated biomarker panel-Appl-1, Sortilin, and Syndecan-1. These biomarkers, which reflect fundamental biological processes within the endosome-lysosome system, offer improved diagnostic precision and prognostic utility for patients with prostate cancer. This review discusses the rationale behind their discovery, the multidisciplinary approach that enabled it, the evidence supporting their use, and their implementation in U.S. clinical practice as a lab-developed test (LDT). We propose this approach as a new diagnostic standard that bridges mechanistic insight with real-world application.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement
41465198,Efficacy and Tolerability of Bupropion in Major Depressive Disorder with Comorbid Anxiety Symptoms: A Systematic Review.,"Anxiety symptoms are highly prevalent in major depressive disorder (MDD) and are associated with greater severity, functional impairment, and poorer treatment outcomes. Bupropion is widely used in clinical practice and is generally considered to have a favorable tolerability profile, but its effects on comorbid anxiety remain uncertain. We conducted a PRISMA-guided systematic review of randomized controlled trials, pooled analyses, and open-label comparative studies evaluating bupropion in adults with MDD and clinically significant anxiety symptoms. Searches of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were performed through August 2025. Outcomes included validated measures of anxiety and depressive symptoms and reported tolerability. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I, and certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. Six studies (n ≈ 3700) met inclusion criteria. Anxiety was a predefined secondary outcome in some trials and a post hoc or exploratory measure in others. Across designs, bupropion was generally associated with improvements in anxiety and depressive symptoms on secondary or exploratory anxiety measures. In pooled patient-level analyses, SSRIs showed a modest advantage over bupropion in patients with high baseline anxiety, whereas individual randomized and open-label studies found no significant between-group differences. None of the included studies reported a clear signal of anxiety worsening with bupropion on the anxiety measures used. Tolerability findings indicated a lower risk of sexual dysfunction with bupropion compared with SSRIs, while insomnia occurred more frequently but was generally manageable. Low-certainty evidence suggests that bupropion may provide clinically relevant improvement in anxiety symptoms in adults with MDD, with generally comparable efficacy to SSRIs in most presentations but a modest SSRI advantage in highly anxious subgroups. Interpretation should consider that anxiety outcomes were often secondary or exploratory and that several studies were at risk of bias. Well-designed randomized trials with anxiety as a primary endpoint are needed.",2025,International journal of molecular sciences,L1_scientific_engagement

41465166,Current and Emerging Protein Biomarkers for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Head and Neck Cancer.,"Head and neck cancer represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent form of head and neck cancer, with a rising incidence in recent years. Risk factors for developing OSCC include exposure to carcinogens, such as alcohol and tobacco products, that can lead to molecular alterations in the oral mucosa and progression from premalignant lesions to invasive phenotypes. Despite the relative curative potential of localized OSCC, the overall prognosis of OSCC has not significantly improved for decades due to a frequently delayed diagnosis and limited targeted treatment options. There remains a need to better characterize the molecular biomarkers of OSCC progression, especially in dysplastic mucosal lesions, before their malignant transformation. In this review, we discuss several molecular biomarkers highly implicated in OSCC tumorigenesis that have demonstrated correlation with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes. These biomarkers are typically involved in vital pathways of carcinogenesis, including cell cycle control, growth factor signaling, and stress responses. They include ubiquitous cancer biomarkers such as p53 and PTEN, as well as those more specific to OSCC, such as DJ-1 and Cornulin. Collectively, we envision that a diverse panel of these biomarkers can provide the greatest clinical benefit in enhancing early detection and prognostic accuracy, while some individual biomarkers may also serve as therapeutic targets for personalized approaches to head and neck cancers.",2025,Genes,L1_scientific_engagement
41465141,Artificial Intelligence-Driven Design of Antisense Oligonucleotides for Precision Medicine in Neuromuscular Disorders.,"Rare neuromuscular disorders impose a significant burden on patients, caregivers, and the health care system, yet, effective disease-modifying therapies remain limited. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, enabling targeted modulation of gene expression through mechanisms such as exon skipping, exon inclusion, and transcript degradation. However, the clinical efficacy of currently approved ASO therapies is often suboptimal. This limitation reflects not only poor target tissue uptake and delivery barriers, but also suboptimal design of ASO sequences and chemical modification patterns, which can compromise potency, safety, and translational robustness. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of ASO optimization platforms such as eSkipFinder and ASOptimizer, which aim to predict effective ASO sequences and chemistries for specific RNA targets. While these tools show considerable promise, their broader applicability remains limited due to a lack of comprehensive validation and the absence of integrated safety considerations. Further refinement and validation are necessary to improve their translational utility. Nevertheless, such platforms represent a critical advancement toward accelerating ASO development. By improving design precision, reducing reliance on extensive preclinical screening, and enabling researchers with limited ASO experience to generate optimized candidates, machine learning is poised to accelerate the development and clinical translation of ASO therapies for rare neuromuscular disorders.",2025,Genes,L1_scientific_engagement
41465138,miRNA as a Prognostic Marker in Small Lung Cell Carcinoma.,"Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive and therapeutically challenging malignancies. It is characterised by rapid progression, early metastasis and frequent relapse. Despite considerable advances in molecular oncology, effective biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response remain elusive. In this review, we summarise and discuss recent evidence on microRNAs (miRNAs) as central regulators of SCLC biology and their potential clinical applications. A narrative review of the literature was conducted. Search of PubMed and Scopus databases identified 14 miRNAs, including miR-7-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-134, miR-181b, miR-200b, miR-335, miR-335-5p, miR-495, miR-24-3p, miR-30a-5p, miR-30a-3p, miR-100, miR-1 and miR-494, which are linked to tumour progression, therapy resistance and metastasis. These molecules influence several signalling cascades, including PI3K/Akt, Hippo, TGF-β, PARP1-mediated DNA repair and autophagy. Their abnormal expression correlates with patient outcome and may enable plasma- or exosome-based non-invasive monitoring. In particular, strategies that restore or inhibit miRNA activity using mimics or antagomiRs show promise in improving drug sensitivity and complementing current treatment options. Overall, emerging evidence supports the integration of miRNA profiling into precision oncology for SCLC, with the aim of refining diagnosis, risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making.",2025,Genes,L1_scientific_engagement

Genetic and epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized as key contributors to both vulnerability and treatment response. We conducted a narrative review of studies published between 2021 and 2025, focusing exclusively on DNA- and RNA-based biomarkers of TRD. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, covering candidate gene analyses, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), neuroimaging-genetic approaches, and microRNA profiling. Genetic investigations consistently implicate neuroplasticity-related genes ( DNA- and RNA-based biomarkers provide promising avenues for improving the understanding and management of TRD.

41464798,The Precision Revolution in Hematologic Malignancies: A Decade of Transformative Immunotherapies and Targeted Agents.,"This review describes the dramatic transformation that has occurred in the last ten years in the therapeutic landscape for hematologic malignancies, such as leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Treatment paradigms have quickly changed from depending solely on cytotoxic chemotherapy to embracing precision medicine, driven by a previously unprecedented understanding of disease biology and precise molecular changes. The development of powerful immunotherapies (such as CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies) and innovative targeted agents (like BTK inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, and immunomodulatory medications) is at the heart of this revolution. In addition to evaluating new and synergistic combination strategies, this paper examines the clinical utility, efficacy, and recent developments of these novel agents. It also addresses important issues like managing acquired drug resistance, minimizing financial burden, and adapting clinical trial designs to keep pace with innovation. These advancements are collectively redefining clinical practice, leading to deeper and more durable responses, and significantly improving the prognosis and quality of life for patients.",2025,Journal of clinical medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41464729,Non-Surgical Correction of Facial Asymmetry: A Narrative Review of Non-Surgical Modalities and Clinical Case Examples.,"Facial asymmetry significantly affects aesthetic appearance, essential functions such as mastication and speech, and psychological well-being. While traditional surgical interventions effectively address significant facial asymmetry, they are often associated with considerable morbidity, prolonged recovery periods, and potential complications. Consequently, interest in minimally invasive, non-surgical techniques has substantially increased, driven by advantages including reduced downtime, rapid recovery, and immediate aesthetic results. This narrative review critically evaluates contemporary non-surgical techniques for correcting facial asymmetry, focusing specifically on dermal fillers, collagen stimulators (polydioxanone powder), polydioxanone thread lifting, energy-based non-invasive devices (radiofrequency, ultrasound, and laser therapies), and extracorporeal shockwave therapy. The review is based on a structured literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar up to October 2025, focusing on human clinical studies and review articles on non-surgical correction of facial asymmetry and related facial contouring. We provide a detailed analysis of each treatment modality's underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy, advantages, limitations, and safety profiles. Current evidence suggests that these non-surgical methods effectively enhance facial symmetry by offering immediate visible improvements and progressive enhancements through natural collagen regeneration, thereby significantly improving patient satisfaction and overall quality of life. Clinicians are encouraged to incorporate these versatile, minimally invasive interventions into clinical practice, carefully tailoring treatments according to individual patient characteristics and specific aesthetic goals. Further research should aim to refine existing treatment protocols, evaluate long-term efficacy and safety, and establish standardized guidelines to optimize outcomes in facial asymmetry correction.",2025,Journal of clinical medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41464633,Finerenone: Extending MRAs Prognostic Benefit to the Recently Hospitalized and More Symptomatic Patient with HFpEF.,"Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism represents a therapeutic cornerstone in patients with HFrEF. However, the efficacy of MRAs in patients HFmrEF or HFpEF remains unclear. While the TOPCAT trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality or hospitalizations for HF in this patient population, post hoc data suggested potential clinical benefits of MRAs in specific patient subgroups. More recently, the landscape has evolved with the FINEARTS-HF trial, which generated novel evidence regarding finerenone, a non-steroidal MRA, in the HFmrEF and HFpEF cohorts. This investigation established a statistically significant decrease in the primary composite endpoint, comprising cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure events. This positive outcome was principally attributable to a lower incidence of total WHF events. Key findings also highlighted the therapy's rapid onset of action and favorable safety profile. Notably, finerenone's benefit was consistent across the entire LVEF spectrum and was not influenced by baseline SGLT2i use, sex, or age. Finerenone's established indication is for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease to reduce heart failure risk. However, based on the findings of the FINEARTS-HF trial, finerenone may represent a novel therapeutic pillar for patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF. In this review, we aim to describe the potential benefits of MRAs in the pathophysiology of HFpEF and HFmrEF and in different patient phenotypes, the results of the FINEARTS-HF trial, and the most important subanalyses of the study.",2025,Journal of clinical medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41464604,Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound in the Diagnosis and Management of Liver Diseases.,"This review explores the evolving role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in the diagnosis and management of liver diseases, with a particular focus on chronic liver disease, focal hepatic lesions, portal hypertension, and post-transplant anatomy. A comprehensive literature review of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase studies up to August 2025 was conducted to identify the latest evidence on EUS-guided procedures, comparing them with traditional techniques. In diagnostics, EUS-guided liver biopsy provides real-time visualisation and precise tissue sampling, achieving longer specimen lengths and better patient outcomes compared to traditional percutaneous and transjugular approaches. For portal hypertension assessment, EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement is a promising alternative to conventional methods, with validation studies demonstrating strong correlation with hepatic venous pressure gradient measurements. In therapeutic applications, EUS facilitates precise interventions including gastric variceal treatment through combined coil and glue injection, management of visceral arterial pseudoaneurysms, selective portal vein embolisation, and targeted tumour ablation. While some applications remain in developmental stages, studies support the safety and efficacy of EUS in improving diagnostic accuracy and expanding therapeutic options for liver diseases. Ongoing technological advances in needle design, imaging capabilities, and artificial intelligence integration are expected to further enhance the utility of EUS in hepatology.",2025,Journal of clinical medicine,L1_scientific_engagement
41464510,Art Therapy and Art Making for Addressing Cancer-Related Pain and Distress in Adult Populations: A Scoping Review.,"Worldwide, cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with symptoms of pain and emotional distress, associated with the disease and its treatment. Art therapy and art making are promising adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for these symptoms. However, current studies do not support replacing pharmacotherapy with these methods. Is there evidence supporting the use of art therapy and/or art making interventions for managing cancer-related pain (primary outcome) and emotional distress (secondary outcome) among adult cancer survivors, during and following active treatment? We searched six databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, ProQuest (library's version), and Google Scholar, using the search terms ""cancer pain"" AND ""art therapy"" OR ""art making."" Inclusion criteria included English language, peer-reviewed studies, on adult cancer survivors. The search yielded 1305 results, with 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. Because emotional distress was frequently discussed in the context of cancer-related pain in the included studies, it was added as a secondary outcome. The efficacy of art therapy/art making to manage cancer-related pain and emotional distress was difficult to determine due to the heterogeneity of study designs and interventions. Of the studies reviewed in which pain was a primary outcome, eight found significant pain reductions, three found small or no effects, and three reviews described art making as a non-verbal method of communicating about pain, but did not address changes in pain levels. The terms ""art therapy"" and ""art making"" were sometimes used interchangeably. The choice of therapeutic approach was sometimes financially driven, and was also impacted by the availability of certified art therapists. Methodological shortcomings of the existing research include small sample sizes, lack of standardized intervention protocols, and inconsistent outcome measures, underscoring the need for more rigorous and generalizable studies. Future research should consider neuroimaging evidence linking aesthetic experiences with activation of the brain's ""reward network"" by utilizing fMRI to study brain activity during art therapy and art making interventions.",2025,International journal of environmental research and public health,L1_scientific_engagement

A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted among pregnant women attending the Fairfield and/or Liverpool antenatal clinic with an Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) score of 10-12 (i.e., just below the generally accepted clinical cut-off score of 13 to indicate subclinical depressive symptoms) during the first antenatal visit (i.e., before 26 weeks gestation). Participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention group which received continuous and coordinated support from a dedicated Registered Midwife (RM) trained in counselling and linked with a multidisciplinary team, or the usual care group, which received standard maternity care from various providers without continuity or additional coordinated support. Primary outcomes included feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery and fidelity, and retention and follow-up. The secondary outcomes were improvement in depressive symptom severity assessed via EDS, psychological distress (Kessler's psychological distress scale-K10), and parenting confidence (Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale (KPCS). Descriptive analyses were used to assess the feasibility outcomes, whereas mixed-effects models were used to examine the effects of treatment on secondary outcomes. Thirty-seven mothers were recruited into the study, of which eighteen were randomised to the intervention group and nineteen to the usual care group. The intervention was delivered with good fidelity, and remote adaptations during COVID-19 ensured both continuity of care and high retention at 6-month follow-up. Findings of the mixed-effects models showed significant within-group reduction in EDS scores over time, with scores at 8 weeks postpartum (T2) significantly lower than at baseline (T0; β = -2.77, SE = 1.36,",2025,International journal of environmental research and public health,L1_scientific_engagement
41464391,Training Nurses for Disasters: A Systematic Review on Self-Efficacy and Preparedness.,"The rising frequency and complexity of disasters underscores the urgent need for robust preparedness in healthcare. Nurses and nursing students, as key frontline responders, often lack sufficient training to respond effectively to emergencies and recovery efforts. This review evaluates the effectiveness of disaster preparedness training in terms of nurses' and nursing students' self-efficacy in providing disaster care and determines which training approaches are most effective. A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed articles published in English between 2014 and 2025 across Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, and Health & Medical Col. Search terms included nurses, nursing students, self-efficacy, disaster training, emergency preparedness, training, simulation and scenario-based learning. Nineteen peer-reviewed studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, disaster preparedness training was found to enhance nurses' and nursing students' self-efficacy, knowledge and skills, with simulation-based and scenario-driven approaches producing the most consistent gains. These methods provided realistic and immersive experiences that fostered confidence and strengthened preparedness. Traditional lectures and workshops also improved outcomes but were generally less effective in sustaining self-efficacy over time. Reported challenges included limited faculty expertise, insufficient institutional support, and psychological barriers that may reduce engagement and impact. Integrating disaster preparedness into nursing curricula and professional training is vital for strengthening nurses' and nursing students' self-efficacy in crisis response. Evidence shows that simulation-based education, particularly when combined with traditional approaches, is especially effective in building knowledge and skills. Embedding these methods into training frameworks offers a sustainable strategy to ensure a more competent and resilient nursing workforce.",2025,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41464345,Non-Invasive Methods for Early Diagnosis of Endometriosis-A Comprehensive Narrative Literature Review.,"Endometriosis is a common gynecological pathology, with an incidence of nearly 10% in patients of reproductive age, and is still underdiagnosed. A thorough and well-spread diagnostic study of endometriosis based on epigenetic factor dysregulation can highlight potential areas for improvement. To quantify the potential and utility of non-invasive tools in the early diagnosis of endometriosis, an overview of current knowledge on epigenetic factors, based on DNA and RNA, is presented. Among these tools, it is important to highlight the role of miRNAs (microRNAs), cfDNA (cell-free DNA), and rRNAs (ribosomal RNAs), which are small molecules involved in endometriosis and numerous other pathologies. To evaluate their potential and utility in endometriosis, a salivary miRNA diagnostic test was conducted, the cfDNA methylation patterns of fragmented DNA circulating in bodily fluids (e.g., plasma) were analyzed, and cervical and uterine microbiomes were profiled for bacterial rRNA in patients with clinical suspicion of incipient endometriosis. Specific molecular profiles associated with endometriosis were analyzed. The first profile, a 109-miRNA saliva signature, was validated as a product of miRNA biomarkers and artificial intelligence modeling. In addition, peripheral blood cfDNA methylation biomarkers were identified by investigating nine genes in a molecular signature that requires validation. A profile was also obtained from cervical swabs and uterine washes, including molecular analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate alterations in the cervical bacterial community. This review aims to optimize the integration of a non-invasive diagnostic tool for early endometriosis diagnosis. Genetic biomarkers can be correlated with clinical factors to improve diagnostic accuracy. Of the assessed diagnostic tools, salivary miRNA tests, a peripheral blood cfDNA methylation biomarker, and a microbiome rRNA signature may be useful for early diagnosis of endometriosis, as well as, implicitly, therapeutic attitude and follow-up.",2025,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

The aim of this review was to summarize the current clinical applications, benefits and limitations of CBCT in endodontic practice. A search of electronic databases identified relevant literature on CBCT applications, innovations, and limitations. Emphasis was placed on identifying contemporary studies published in the last 5 years. In general, CBCT demonstrates better diagnostic efficacy across multiple applications, including identifying complex anatomy, detection of apical periodontitis, pre-surgical planning and the diagnosis and management of longitudinal root fractures, traumatic dental injuries and root resorptions. However, clinicians should balance the benefits of CBCT against its shortcomings, such as increased radiation exposure, presence of artifacts and higher costs. Proper use requires adherence to guidelines, optimized machine settings, and interpretation by trained individuals.

41463824,Treatment and Prevention of Cardiogenic Arterial Thromboembolism in the Cat: A Systematic Review.,"Feline cardiogenic arterial thromboembolism (ATE) is a severe complication of cardiac disease in cats, often causing severe clinical signs and poor prognosis. Despite its importance, standardized guidelines for prevention and treatment are lacking. This systematic review evaluated available evidence on preventive, acute, and chronic management strategies for feline cardiogenic ATE. A comprehensive search using PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science was performed, following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Peer-reviewed studies investigating therapeutic interventions for ATE were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool. Nineteen studies involving 909 cats were included. Preventive therapy with clopidogrel and rivaroxaban improved survival. Acute multimodal treatment combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs improved survival compared to monotherapy. Thrombolytic therapy showed some efficacy but had frequent severe complications. Long-term management with clopidogrel and rivaroxaban achieved the longest survival and lowest recurrence, while acetylsalicylic acid provided inconsistent benefits and more adverse effects. Eleven of the nineteen (58%) studies had high risk of bias due to small sample size and heterogeneous protocols. Current evidence supports dual therapy, particularly clopidogrel with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin, as the most effective and well-tolerated approach for prevention and treatment. Larger, standardized prospective trials are urgently needed to strengthen the evidence.",2025,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,L1_scientific_engagement

This growing threat, coupled with the stagnation in the development of novel antibiotics, necessitates the investigation of alternative antimicrobial strategies. Plant-derived essential oils (EOs) have emerged as promising candidates due to their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, multi-targeted mechanisms, and capacity to enhance the efficacy of existing antibiotics. Recent studies have underscored the potential of EOs in disrupting biofilms, inhibiting quorum sensing, modulating efflux pumps, and reversing resistance in a variety of bacterial pathogens, including those listed as priorities by the World Health Organization. Notably, many of these effects have been demonstrated against resistant strains isolated directly from clinical samples, thereby enhancing the translational significance of EOs. In addition to their antimicrobial properties, advances in analytical, omics-based, and microfluidic technologies have further elucidated the mechanisms of EOs and may accelerate their therapeutic development. Nevertheless, challenges such as variability in composition, lack of standardized testing protocols, and limited in vivo data continue to impede clinical application. Therefore, the aim of this scoping review is to critically examine the advances over the past decade in the antibacterial activity of plant EOs against clinical isolates, with a particular focus on their efficacy against resistant bacterial pathogens and their potential role in combating AMR.",2025,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Despite decades of research, a unified framework linking its spectral features, physiological underpinnings, and analytical complexity is still missing. In this narrative review, we synthesize spectral and nonlinear pupillometry studies to propose a paradigm-aware taxonomy of hippus frequency bands that integrates evidence from autonomic tests and cognitive-arousal paradigms. Across the literature, low-frequency components tend to covary with respiratory/vasomotor autonomic rhythms, while higher-frequency fluctuations and complexity indices are more sensitive to cognitive load, visual fatigue, and pathological states but remain methodologically heterogeneous. Finally, we explore contexts in which hippus-based biomarkers show clinical potential, with a main focus on glaucoma as an emerging translational model, while underscoring the methodological and translational gaps that currently hinder their validation and routine clinical adoption. Physiology, spectral metrics, and complexity-based analyses are integrated to lay the foundations of a coherent framework.",2025,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, has gained attention in ophthalmic imaging, offering opportunities to improve both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This review examined applications of AI in DR and DME published between 2010 and 2025. A narrative search of PubMed and Google Scholar identified English-language, peer-reviewed studies, with additional screening of reference lists. Eligible articles evaluated AI algorithms for detection, classification, prognosis, or treatment monitoring, with study selection guided by PRISMA 2020. Of 300 records screened, 60 met the inclusion criteria. Most reported strong diagnostic performance, with sensitivities up to 96% and specificities up to 98% for detecting referable DR on fundus photographs. Algorithms trained on optical coherence tomography (OCT) data showed high accuracy for identifying DME, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values frequently exceeding 0.90. Several models also predicted anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment response and recurrence of fluid with encouraging results. Autonomous AI tools have gained regulatory approval and have been implemented in clinical practice, though performance can vary depending on image quality, device differences, and patient populations.

We first appraise traditional two-dimensional (2D) monolayers and animal models, noting scalability and historical utility alongside constrained translational fidelity. We then evaluate advanced systems-patient-derived organoids (PDOs), patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and organ-on-a-chip-that better recapitulate architecture, microenvironmental cues, and pharmacodynamics (PD), yet face trade-offs in throughput, timelines, costs, and standardization. Functional genomic screens (CRISPR/RNAi) and large-scale pharmacogenomics are summarized as engines for mechanism-based target discovery and resistance mapping, while AI-enabled modeling supports response prediction, biomarker development, and rational combinations. Finally, we discuss trial designs (basket/umbrella), drug repurposing lessons, and regulatory momentum for new approach methodologies. Across platforms, we emphasize cross-model validation, dataset harmonization, and clinically anchored endpoints as prerequisites for real-world impact.

41463593,Evaluation of Long-Term Outcomes of Enamel Matrix Derivative in the Treatment of Peri-Implant Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has been proposed as an adjunctive treatment for peri-implantitis, a prevalent complication of dental implants characterized by inflammatory responses and progressive bone loss around the implant site. This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of EMD compared with control interventions in the treatment of peri-implantitis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSHs) and free-text terms. The search included three major electronic databases-Medline via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase-and studies published up to November 2024. The search aimed to identify relevant clinical trials assessing the long-term outcomes of EMD in peri-implantitis treatment. Out of an initial 54 articles identified, five met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference for probing depth reduction with EMD compared to controls was 0.88 (95% confidence of interval (CI): -1.26 to 2.02). The decrease in bleeding on probing yielded a pooled mean difference of 16.70 (95% CI: -4.93 to 38.32). For bone level gain, the pooled mean difference was 0.59 (95% CI: -0.01 to 1.19). This meta-analysis indicated that the most significant improvement with the use of EMD was observed in bone level gain with surgical approach. Moreover, the adjunctive use of EMD in the treatment of peri-implantitis may offer clinical benefits in reducing probing depth and bleeding on probing at the three-month evaluation. These findings support the consideration of EMD as a valuable adjunct in peri-implantitis treatment protocols, warranting further investigation through well-designed, long-term randomized controlled trials.",2025,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41463571,The Role of TRPV1 in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is an ion channel expressed in sensory neurons, immune cells, pancreatic islets, and vascular tissues. Initially recognized for its role in thermosensation and nociception, TRPV1 has emerged as a key regulator of immune modulation, β-cell physiology, vascular integrity, and neuroimmune signaling-processes central to the pathogenesis and progression of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Experimental evidence demonstrates that TRPV1 exerts opposing effects on β-cell physiology-enhancing insulin release during short-term activation, yet accelerating stress and cell loss under chronic stimulation. In the vascular and renal systems, TRPV1 contributes to hallmark T1D complications, including endothelial dysfunction, nephropathy, and impaired cardiovascular protection, while in the central nervous system it drives neuroinflammation, cognitive decline, and emotional dysregulation. TRPV1 sensitization also accelerates the onset and severity of diabetic neuropathy by amplifying pain and inflammatory signaling pathways. Genetic and epigenetic regulation further links TRPV1 to individual susceptibility and disease progression. Collectively, these findings position TRPV1 as both a disease-modifying factor and a determinant of T1D outcomes, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in autoimmune diabetes.",2025,Biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41463563,Prospects for Development and Commercialisation of Allogeneic CAR-Based Therapies for Autoimmune Disease.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies represent a promising therapeutic approach for refractory autoimmune diseases. Although autologous CAR-T cells have achieved success thus far, they require expensive, individualised manufacturing, limiting their commercialisation potential. Allogeneic alternatives could overcome these scalability barriers, providing 'off-the-shelf' treatments, although they raise the issues of graft-vs-host reactions and host-mediated rejection. To mitigate such risks, gene-edited αβ T cells or non-alloreactive host cells (e.g., NK cells, γδ T cells) may be used. This review evaluates evidence of the functionality and commercial potential of various allogeneic CAR-T solutions for autoimmunity. Searches were conducted of PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science to extract clinical and preclinical studies of allogeneic CAR-T cells, for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and B or T cell malignancies. In light of the paucity of data on autoimmune disease, the latter were included to facilitate extrapolation to the autoimmune setting. A total of 107 studies were included. The available clinical outcomes of efficacy and safety, as well as preclinical key findings, are reported. Current developments and potential future improvements for safety, effectiveness and cost-effective manufacture are then discussed. The findings of this review demonstrate the promising therapeutic potential of allogeneic CAR-T for autoimmune disease, with scope for the further optimisation of safety and scalable manufacture to facilitate commercialisation.",2025,Biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41463504,Immune Checkpoint Restoration as a Therapeutic Strategy to Halt Diabetes-Driven Atherosclerosis.,"Diabetic atherosclerosis results from the interplay between metabolic dysfunction and immune dysregulation and remains the major cause of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that impaired immune checkpoint signaling, particularly through the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, contributes to the chronic vascular inflammation characteristic of diabetic cardiovascular disease. These checkpoints normally help maintain vascular homeostasis by limiting proatherogenic immune responses. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), which accounts for 90-95% of cases, chronic hyperglycemia downregulates checkpoint expression in both immune effector cells and the vascular endothelium. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune-mediated checkpoint failure within the pancreatic islets extends to the vascular tissues, creating an early cardiovascular risk through overlapping but distinct mechanisms. The loss of checkpoint regulation amplifies Th1 and Th17 responses while impairing regulatory T cell function and accelerating plaque formation and destabilization. Observations from cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, who exhibit increased cardiovascular events, further highlight the importance of these pathways in vascular integrity. Restoring checkpoint signaling through targeted interventions, combined with biomarker-driven stratification and personalized immune profiling, may provide new strategies for preventing or slowing atherosclerotic progression in patients with diabetes.",2025,Biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41463450,Unlocking New Horizons: Antibody-Drug Conjugates in Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), an emerging class of antitumor agents, have revolutionised the therapeutic landscape in oncology by integrating the cytotoxic efficacy of chemotherapy with the precision of targeted therapy. These agents have also demonstrated considerable potential in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Numerous clinical trials evaluating ADCs in SCLC are currently underway. Although encouraging outcomes have been observed, several challenges persist, including drug resistance, treatment-related toxicities, and the identification of suitable biomarkers for patient selection. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying ADCs, along with a systematic review of their clinical development in SCLC, may provide valuable insights and strategies to address these issues. In this review, we elucidate the structure and mechanisms of action of ADCs, summarise key clinical trials in SCLC, discuss existing challenges, and suggest future directions to facilitate the advancement and clinical application of ADC-based therapies for SCLC.",2025,Biology,L1_scientific_engagement
41463366,Integrative Regulatory Networks of MicroRNA-483: Unveiling Its Systematic Role in Human Diseases and Clinical Implications.,"MicroRNA-483 regulates multiple human disease categories, spanning oncology, cardiopulmonary, metabolic, immune, neurological, and musculoskeletal pathologies. We integrate experimentally validated interactions from 146 studies to construct a comprehensive regulatory network, encompassing transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, and messenger RNA targets. Our analysis reveals that miR-483 promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing tumor-suppressive checkpoints, yet it protects cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and neurological tissues from pathological injury. This functional duality arises from tissue-specific modulation of shared signaling pathways, particularly TGF-β and MAPK cascades, which function as the core hubs driving its context-dependent activity across six disease categories. By mapping miR-483 regulatory circuits across multiple diseases, we define the molecular determinants of its context-dependent activity. These findings establish miR-483 as both a diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target whose function is dictated by cellular context.",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement

Although the active site residues are typically located in only one half, both parts are essential for proper enzyme function. The M16 family includes many proteins that are crucial for the physiology of the organism and, therefore, are the subject of intensive research. The flagship examples are insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), mitochondrial processing peptidases (MPPs), and mitochondrial and chloroplast presequence peptidases (PrePs). The substrates of these enzymes include many biologically important peptides, such as insulin and amyloid β.

Lipid rafts, dynamic membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids, have emerged as potential targets for TIME remodeling through their integration of immune signal transduction, enrichment of cell death receptors, and regulation of immune cell functionality. This review outlines the pivotal mediating roles of lipid rafts in cellular survival, death, and tumor progression. Specifically, MSS-type CRC exhibits lipid raft structural remodeling driven by dysregulated lipid metabolism, which fosters multiple immune escape mechanisms through exosome-mediated immunosuppressive signaling, promotion of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) M2 polarization, enhanced infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and functional exhaustion of effector cells, such as CD8",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement

This review integrates knowledge on CBD's pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical implementation, with focus on metabolism, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and clinically relevant interactions with antiseizure medications. CBD exerts CB1/CB2-independent mechanisms-prominently GPR55 antagonism, TRP-channel desensitization, and adenosine-mediated network dampening-supporting efficacy across heterogeneous seizure phenotypes. Its pharmacokinetic profile is characterized by low and variable oral bioavailability, a pronounced food effect, extensive tissue distribution, and phase I/II biotransformation to the active 7-hydroxy-CBD and abundant 7-carboxy-CBD, resulting in substantial inter-individual variability and liability for drug-drug interactions. Clinically salient interactions include CYP2C19-mediated elevation of N-desmethylclobazam and increased transaminases in valproate co-therapy. We summarize emerging TDM practices-standardized fed-state trough sampling with paired measurement of CBD and 7-hydroxy-CBD-and discuss how preliminary interpretive ranges can support dose optimization, adherence assessment, and safety surveillance. Practical recommendations emphasize interaction-aware titration within evidence-based dose bands, liver function monitoring, and standardized documentation of formulation and sampling conditions. Future work should align pharmacogenomics with TDM, refine bioavailability through advanced delivery systems, and tighten analytical and product-quality standards to consolidate CBD as a precision-ready component of modern epilepsy care.",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement
41463312,Hyaluronic Acid in Topical Applications: The Various Forms and Biological Effects of a Hero Molecule in the Cosmetics Industry.,"Hyaluronan, or hyaluronic acid (HA), is a glycosaminoglycan with structural and signaling functions playing key roles in human skin homeostasis. It ensures hydration and biomechanical properties of this tissue as well as regulates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and inflammation. Its biocompatibility, viscoelastic properties, biological functions, and large-scale sustainable bioproduction made this polysaccharide a hero molecule of the cosmetic industry. A literature search was conducted to discuss the skin and hair benefits of the external use of HA and its derivatives. Four main questions were addressed: What are the different forms of HA in cosmetic formulations? What about their safety? Does HA penetrate human skin and hair? What are the benefits and mode of actions of HA, and its derivatives, in the fields of cosmetic and dermatology? The analysis revealed HA below 100 kDa to penetrate skin, and lower molecular weight being able to reach the dermis. The safety of HA-containing formulations has been evaluated in several clinical trials and is supported by independent reports of commercial ingredients. We described HA molecules having beneficial effects on skin and hair, as well as their mode of action. This review provides comprehensive information on the nature and efficacy of topical HA, and its derivatives, in cosmetic applications, with an emphasis on hair care.

41463310,Embryological Divergence and Molecular Mechanisms in Thoracic and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Bridging Developmental Biology and Clinical Insights.,"Aortic aneurysms are complex, predominantly asymptomatic vascular diseases with distinct incidence patterns depending on anatomical localisation. The incidence of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) has moderately increased, whereas that of abdominal aortic aneurysms has declined, primarily due to public health measures. Undiagnosed or poorly managed aneurysms are at significant risk of progression to acute aortic syndrome, with high associated mortality. The embryological origins of the aorta may have a substantial impact on its structural, cellular, and functional heterogeneity. Specifically, smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) in the thoracic aorta are derived from cardiac neural crest and mesodermal cells, whereas abdominal aortic SMCs originate from the paraxial and splanchnic mesoderm. To explore these developmental and regional distinctions, we conducted a narrative review based on targeted literature retrieval and expert curation, highlighting how these distinctions might potentially influence susceptibility to aneurysms and their clinical presentation. Histological differences, such as the number of lamellar units and the presence or absence of vasa vasorum, could further explain regional vulnerability. Molecular mechanisms underlying aneurysm formation include inflammation, oxidative stress, extracellular matrix degradation, phenotypic switching, and dysregulated signalling pathways, notably transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and angiotensin II. Genetic mutations significantly contribute to TAAs, with genes involved in the elastin-contractile unit and TGF-β signalling pathways playing pivotal roles. However, the complex interplay between genetic susceptibility and risk factors explains why some patients develop aneurysms while others do not. Clinical management strategies have evolved, emphasising early risk stratification, surveillance, and timely surgical intervention, guided increasingly by genetic profiling and segment-specific molecular understanding. Advances in genomic technologies, biomarker identification, and computational modelling promise to enhance individualised care. Bridging developmental biology, molecular genetics, and clinical practice is crucial for improving outcomes in patients with aortic aneurysms, thereby reinforcing a multidisciplinary approach to patient-centred cardiovascular medicine.",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement
41463309,"Chronic β-Blockade and Systemic Homeostasis: Molecular Integration of Cardiorenal and Immune Pathways, a Narrative Review.","β-blockers (BBs) remain a cornerstone therapy for cardiovascular disorders, reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and arrhythmia risk. Yet, their influence extends well beyond the heart, impacting renal function, inflammatory responses, metabolism, and endocrine balance. Although cardio-selective BBs are designed to minimize off-target effects, they still modulate immune signaling and hormonal pathways, producing paradoxical outcomes. Suppression of sympathetic tone and RAAS activity underpins therapeutic benefit but may also contribute to renal hypoperfusion, electrolyte imbalance, and pro-inflammatory changes, especially in patients receiving combination therapy with RAAS inhibitors or diuretics. Genetic polymorphisms (e.g., ADRB1, GRK5, eNOS, CYP2D6) and comorbidities further shape individual responses. This review integrates cardiovascular, renal, and immune perspectives to map the pathways by which BBs influence systemic homeostasis, highlighting cytokine interactions and disease-specific remodeling. We emphasize the need for personalized, biomarker-guided strategies, leveraging pharmacogenomics, multi-omics, and machine learning tools to optimize BB selection and dosing.

41463308,IP6: From Seeds to Science-A Natural Compound's Path to Clinical Promise.,"Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), also known as phytic acid, has historically been classified as an antinutrient due to its mineral-chelating properties, which were believed to impair nutrient absorption. Early reports fueled concerns that high dietary phytate intake could contribute to mineral deficiencies, albeit without direct scientific evidence, particularly in populations lacking dietary diversity. However, lifetime animal experiments have demonstrated that IP6 does not have any negative effect on mineral bioavailability and if there is any in humans, it is largely context-dependent. Even more importantly, beyond nutritional implications, IP6 has emerged as a bioactive molecule with promising therapeutic potential across various cancer types and clinical conditions. Preclinical and clinical research indicate that IP6, alone or in tandem with inositol (Ins), selectively targets cancer cells and enhances chemotherapy efficacy. Growing evidence also suggests that IP6 plays a protective role in cardiovascular health, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic diseases. While clinical trials remain limited, extensive in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies support a shift in how IP6 is perceived among the scientific community-moving from an antinutrient to a health-promoting compound. As research progresses, further clinical investigations are essential to fully elucidate IP6's therapeutic applications and its benefit to disease prevention.",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement
41463298,From Fat to Brain: Adiponectin as a Mediator of Neuroplasticity in Depression.,"Depression is a leading cause of global disability and is increasingly recognized as a multifactorial disorder characterized by fundamental disruptions in neuroplasticity, including diminished hippocampal neurogenesis, impaired synaptic plasticity, and dysregulated stress-response systems. Given the limited efficacy of conventional pharmacological treatments, lifestyle-based interventions-most notably physical exercise-have gained considerable attention for their antidepressant effects, partly mediated by secreted exerkines. Among these, adiponectin has emerged as a particularly compelling candidate linking metabolic regulation to neuroplasticity and mood. Recent evidence suggests that adiponectin contributes to the antidepressant effects of exercise by modulating hippocampal neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling. Despite these advances, the mechanisms by which adiponectin influences depression remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current knowledge on adiponectin's role in depression pathophysiology, with emphasis on its capacity to enhance neuroplasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, and its potential to mediate exercise-induced antidepressant effects via defined molecular pathways. Building on these insights, we discuss adiponectin's translational promise as both a predictive biomarker of treatment response and a novel therapeutic target. By integrating preclinical and clinical evidence, this review offers a comprehensive perspective on adiponectin's involvement in depression while identifying critical gaps to guide future mechanistic research.",2025,Biomolecules,L1_scientific_engagement
41463272,The Impact of Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) on Head and Neck Cancers: From Biology to Therapy.,"Cellular senescence is defined as a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, providing a natural barrier against cancer. However, senescent cells are very metabolically active and secrete a complex mixture of bioactive molecules collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which play a dual role in cancer biology. While the SASP can suppress tumors by facilitating immunosurveillance, it can also promote tumor progression by fostering a pro-inflammatory milieu, stimulating angiogenesis, enhancing invasiveness, and enabling immune evasion. In Head and Neck Cancers (HNCs), a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, SASP has emerged as a critical player in disease progression and treatment resistance. Persistent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling drives SASP and thereby contributes to the progression of head and neck cancer by modulating the tumour microenvironment. It influences the tumor microenvironment (TME) by facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer stem cell-like properties, and impairing the efficacy of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These effects underscore the need for targeted interventions to regulate SASP activity. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASP generation and its effects on HNCs. We discuss the dual roles of SASP in tumor suppression and progression, its contribution to therapy resistance, and emerging therapeutic strategies, including novel senolytic and senomorphic drugs. Finally, we highlight key challenges and future directions for translating SASP-targeted therapies into clinical practice, emphasizing the need for biomarker discovery, and a deeper understanding of SASP heterogeneity. By targeting the SASP, there is potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve the management of HNCs.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463269,HER2-Low and HER2-Ultralow Metastatic Breast Cancer and Trastuzumab Deruxtecan: Common Clinical Questions and Answers.,"Approximately 80% of invasive breast cancers are classified as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative; however, many of these tumors have detectable levels of HER2 surface expression. Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate with a membrane-permeable payload that is cytotoxic to both HER2-expressing tumor cells and neighboring cells via the bystander antitumor effect. T-DXd has shown significant antitumor activity in clinical trials for patients with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]+) breast cancer. In addition, the results of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial demonstrated the clinical benefit of T-DXd in patients with HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer after receiving prior chemotherapy. DESTINY-Breast06 demonstrated the clinical benefit of T-DXd in patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-), and HER2-ultralow (IHC 0 with membrane staining) metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior chemotherapy in the advanced setting. These results validate the need for a standard-of-care diagnostic test to identify HER2-low and HER2-ultralow expression levels in patients with metastatic breast cancer to guide therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, effective treatment sequencing strategies and adverse event management are essential for maximizing patient benefit. This review presents the identification of HER2-low and HER2-ultralow breast cancer, sequencing of T-DXd with other treatments, and management of common or clinically significant adverse events reported with T-DXd.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463268,"Determinants of Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Pleural Mesothelioma: Molecular, Immunological, and Clinical Perspectives.","Diffuse pleural mesothelioma (PM) is a rare thoracic malignancy with historically limited treatment options and poor outcomes. Despite the recent breakthrough of dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-notably the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies-clinical responses remain variable and overall survival gains modest. Consequently, there is an urgent need for multidimensional biomarkers and adaptive trial designs to unravel the complexity of PM immune biology. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current evidence on how histological subtypes (epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid) influence ICB efficacy, highlighting distinct genetic landscapes (e.g., BAP1, CDKN2A, NF2 mutations) and tumor microenvironment (TME) features, including immune infiltration patterns and PD-L1 or VISTA expression, that underlie differential responses. We further examine intrinsic tumor factors-such as mutational burden and checkpoint ligand expression-and extrinsic determinants, including immune cell composition, stromal architecture, patient immune status, and microbiota, as modulators of immunotherapy outcomes. We also discuss the rationale behind emerging strategies designed to enhance ICB efficacy, currently under clinical evaluation. These include combination regimens with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, epigenetic modulators, anti-angiogenic agents, and novel immunotherapies such as next-generation checkpoint inhibitors (LAG-3, VISTA), immune-suppressive cell-targeting agents, vaccines, cell-based therapies, and oncolytic viruses. Collectively, these advancements underscore the importance of integrating histological classification with molecular and microenvironmental profiling to refine patient selection and guide the development of combination strategies aimed at transforming ""cold"" mesotheliomas into ""hot,"" immune-responsive tumors, thereby enhancing the efficacy of ICB.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463267,Therapeutic Applications of Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)-Binding Radiopharmaceuticals: Review of Opportunities and Challenges.,"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-binding radiopharmaceuticals have emerged as promising candidates for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in oncology due to their selective targeting of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). This review evaluates the current literature on the therapeutic use of FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals in human studies, with a focus on their safety, efficacy, and clinical applicability. Data on radionuclide type, clinical outcome, radiological and metabolic response and adverse events were extracted and summarized. The included studies demonstrated that lutetium-177,yttrium-90 and actinium-225 (in combination therapy) labeled FAP inhibitors exhibit high tumor uptake, with varying but mostly sufficient retention and a favorable safety profile. While mild adverse events such as fatigue, nausea and grade 1 or 2 hematotoxicity were observed, severe toxicities were rare. FAPI-based radionuclide therapies generally show high disease control rates, with promising results from tandem and combination strategies. The heterogeneity of tumor types and small sample sizes limited the generalizability of findings. FAP-targeted radioligand therapy appears to be a promising treatment option for patients with advanced cancer who have exhausted standard therapies. However, further large-scale, prospective clinical trials are necessary to determine optimal dosing strategies, long-term safety and efficacy across different tumor types. Emerging approaches, such as covalently binding FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals and the use of alpha-emitters such as actinium-225, lead-212 and bismuth-213, may further enhance treatment outcomes and warrant future investigation.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463264,The Management of Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: State of the Art and Future Perspectives.,"Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) represents a highly aggressive malignancy associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current standard treatment, which includes radical cystectomy and platinum-based chemotherapy, is burdened by high toxicity and a substantial risk of relapse. For this reason, over the past decade, novel therapeutic strategies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and targeted therapies have been investigated. This review aims to summarize current clinical evidence and ongoing trials evaluating these approaches in the perioperative setting. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases, along with abstracts from major oncology conferences (ASCO, ESMO, SGO). Clinical trials assessing ICIs, ADCs, and targeted therapies, either alone or in combination with each other or with chemotherapy, in MIBC, were included. Several early-phase and phase III trials have investigated the perioperative management of MIBC. Various studies evaluated the addition of ICIs to standard chemotherapy, demonstrating promising results in terms of pathological complete response. In parallel, the encouraging outcomes with ICIs and ADCs alone in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting paved the way for their combination in integrated strategies. Biomarker-driven approaches, based on circulating tumor DNA and specific genomic alterations, are being actively explored to improve patient selection and personalize treatment. ICIs, ADCs, and targeted therapies are reshaping the therapeutic landscape of MIBC. While early results are promising, further data and biomarker validation are essential to establish their definitive role and guide clinical decision-making in the perioperative setting.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement

Differences in diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes are influenced by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and geographical location. Brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors rank 19th in global cancer incidence and 12th in cancer-related mortality. U.S. Incidence is higher in females and individuals with greater socioeconomic means, contrasting with global patterns where males are more affected. Glioblastoma has a wide variation in incidence and survival by state, with rural regions showing higher mortality despite lower incidence, often due to reduced access to specialized care. Non-Hispanic Black children with CNS tumors experience higher mortality than their White peers, even after adjusting for SES. Outcomes are generally poorer in low- and middle-income countries, where healthcare infrastructure remains limited. Biological and genetic differences may also influence treatment response and tumor behavior across population groups. This review outlines key variations in brain tumor care, with a key focus on the United States, and emphasizes the need for patient-centered strategies to ensure timely diagnosis, consistent treatment, and improved outcomes.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement

41463210,Updating the Role of Carboplatin Added to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor prognosis and a high risk of early relapse. The incorporation of platinum-based agents into neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimens has been linked to improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates. However, the clinical benefit of carboplatin (CBDCA) remains debated due to variable long-term survival outcomes and concerns over cumulative toxicity. This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of adding CBDCA to NACT in early-stage TNBC (eTNBC). A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, and major oncology conference proceedings (2014-2024), with no language restrictions. Randomized phase II-III trials assessing the addition of CBDCA to standard NACT in eTNBC and reporting pCR and survival outcomes were included. The systematic review followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The protocol has not been registered. The primary endpoint was pCR; the secondary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). For pCR, a random-effects model was used, and odds ratios (OR) were log-transformed. For DFS, a mixed-effects model was applied, extracting hazard ratios (HR) and converting them into logHR values. Heterogeneity was assessed using I Of 30 studies identified, 9 randomized clinical trials were eligible; 6 (BrighTNess, GeparSixto, GS5-01, BR-15-1 PEARLY, NACATRINE, CALGB 40603) met all inclusion criteria, totaling 3402 patients. The addition of CBDCA to NACT significantly improved pCR (OR 1.63; 95% CI: 1.38-1.92; Adding carboplatin to NACT significantly improves pCR and DFS in patients with early-stage TNBC.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement

Oncolytic viruses (OVs), which selectively infect and lyse tumor cells while engaging antitumor immunity, offer a mechanistically distinct therapeutic modality. This review synthesizes clinical progress of OVs in GBM, with emphasis on oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) and coverage of other vectors (adenovirus, reovirus, Newcastle disease virus, vaccinia virus) across phase I-III trials, focusing on efficacy and safety. Key observations include the encouraging clinical trajectory of oHSV exemplars-T-VEC (approved for melanoma) and G47Δ (approved in Japan for recurrent GBM)-the multi-center exploration of the adenovirus DNX-2401 combined with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade, and the early-stage status of reovirus (pelareorep) and Newcastle disease virus programs. Emerging evidence indicates that oHSV therapy augments immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment and alleviates immunosuppression, with synergy when combined with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Persistent challenges include GBM's inherently immunosuppressive milieu, limitations imposed by the blood-brain barrier, intrapatient viral delivery and biodistribution, and concerns about viral shedding. Future directions encompass programmable vector design, optimization of systemic delivery, biomarker-guided patient selection, and rational combination immunotherapy. Collectively, OVs represent a promising immunotherapeutic strategy in GBM; further gains will hinge on vector engineering and precision combinations to translate mechanistic promise into durable clinical benefit.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement

Increasing evidence highlights the relevance of the gut-lung axis in immune response modulation, tumor progression, and treatment outcomes. Within this inter-organ network, bacterial extracellular vesicles (bEVs), nanosized particles containing proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites, serve as important mediators of host-microbiota communication, influencing immune regulation, metabolic pathways, and tumor biology. This review explores EV-mediated mechanisms involved in LC pathogenesis, including immune modulation, epigenetic regulation, and microbial metabolite signaling. The mechanistic influence of environmental and dietary factors on bEV composition and function is further explored, and emerging translational applications, ranging from diagnostic biomarker development to drug delivery strategies and modulation of immunotherapy responses, are discussed.

41463194,Antibody-Drug Conjugates and Beyond: Next-Generation Targeted Therapies for Breast Cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the most important cause of cancer-related death in females worldwide. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) represent a novel class of targeted therapies that combine the precision of monoclonal antibodies with the potent cell-killing activity of cytotoxic drugs. This review highlights recent mechanistic, technological, and clinical developments of ADCs in breast cancer, including next-generation ADCs beyond those that target HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Authors performed a systematic literature study for ADCs and their structural features, including their components (antibody, linker, and payload) and their therapeutic efficacy. A frame of preclinical research findings and clinical evidence integration of HER2-targeted therapy outcomes in HER2-positive, HER2-low, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes were presented. Clinical studies of antibody-drug conjugates such as trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), and sacituzumab govitecan have demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival and overall survival across diverse breast cancer patient populations. ADCs offer unique advantages in breast cancer therapy by combining the precision of targeted antibodies with the potency of chemotherapy drugs. This allows them to selectively kill cancer cells, overcome resistance, reduce toxicity to healthy tissues, and expand treatment options for difficult subtypes like HER2-low and triple-negative breast cancer. Unlike previous reviews focusing on HER2-targeted ADCs, herein we review exciting ADCs targeting HER3 HER3 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 3) and Nectin-4, as well as the implications of bispecific and immune-stimulatory ADCs in the clinic. Additionally, it features mechanism-based innovations and novel trial data that revolutionize ADC applications in the HER2-low as well as the triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. The advent of ADC is changing precision oncology in breast cancer. With a new design and indications evolving, they are an attractive avenue for bypassing resistance and reducing toxicity and ultimately improving patient outcomes in the molecular subtypes. The present review summarizes recent advancements in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and emerging targeted therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. It covers mechanistic insights, linker-payload innovations, receptor-based targeting approaches, clinical trial progress, and next-generation modalities that extend beyond HER2-directed ADCs. Current challenges, safety profiles, and future opportunities in engineering more selective and effective ADC platforms are also discussed.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463180,Developing New Immunotherapy Approaches for Colorectal Cancer.,"Immunotherapy represents a groundbreaking approach for treating colorectal cancer (CRC), harnessing the body's own immune system to target tumour cells more precisely than conventional chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4, have shown remarkable efficacy in certain patients, leading to durable responses and improved survival. However, the majority of CRC cases have limited benefit from a single agent checkpoint blockade. There is a growing need to identify biomarkers that will improve the selection of patients who will best respond to therapy, as well as new targets to sensitise cancers to an immune checkpoint blockade. Unfortunately, the search for reliable biomarkers has been limited by our incomplete understanding of how immunotherapies modify the already complex immune response to cancer. Revolutionary techniques, such as genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening combined with the appropriate validation systems such as in vivo mouse models and/or 3D organoid co-culture systems, are being used to address this knowledge gap. This review will focus on the use of immunotherapies in CRC, discuss why most CRC patients do not respond, and highlight in vitro, in vivo, and novel techniques for discovery of new targets for combination treatment.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463153,CA19-9 as a Dynamic Biomarker for Continuous Monitoring of Therapeutic Efficacy in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to late-stage diagnosis and limited therapeutic efficacy. The carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is the most widely used serum biomarker in the management of PDAC. While CA19-9 has significant limitations as a screening or diagnostic tool, including low sensitivity for early-stage disease and a lack of expression in the Lewis antigen-negative population, its value in the post-diagnostic setting is well established. This review examines the production and clearance dynamics of CA19-9. It critically evaluates how these factors impact its role as a biomarker for prognosis, assessment of resectability, and real-time monitoring of therapeutic response and recurrence in patients with PDAC. We explore how the relatively short half-life and correlation with tumor burden make CA19-9 a dynamic tool for tracking disease progression and treatment efficacy, often providing insights that precede radiographic changes. This review concludes that, despite its limitations, CA19-9 remains an important, cost-effective, and widely accessible biomarker for the longitudinal management of patients with established pancreatic cancer. Its dynamic changes allow continuous real-time disease monitoring providing critical information for clinical decision-making.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement
41463143,The Rise of Fine-Tuned CAR-Based Therapies Against Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous and aggressive hematologic malignancy with poor prognosis despite multiple available therapies. While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed the treatment of B-cell malignancies, its application in AML has been limited by early relapses and severe toxicities. Unlike B-cell antigens, most AML-associated surface antigens are also expressed on healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, creating significant risks of on-target/off-tumor toxicity and prolonged myeloablation. To address the scarcity of AML-specific targets, several innovative CAR strategies have been developed to enhance precision, safety, and efficacy. Logic-gated CARs improve selectivity through dual-antigen recognition or conditional activation. Drug-inducible and transient expression systems, as well as pharmacologic or suicide switches, enable controlled modulation or elimination of CAR cells to reduce toxicity. Adapter CAR platforms allow real-time, flexible targeting, while engineered modulation of gene expression or cytokine secretion enhances persistence and antitumor activity. Finally, alternative immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, provide versatile platforms that may overcome limitations of conventional T-cell therapies, such as fratricide or challenges in allogeneic use. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these emerging CAR approaches, highlighting their advantages, limitations, and potential to expand immunotherapeutic strategies for AML.",2025,Cancers,L1_scientific_engagement

By analyzing circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor cells, exosomal non-coding RNAs, and proteomic or metabolomic profiles, clinicians can monitor clonal evolution, therapeutic response, and recurrence risk in real time. Recent advances in sequencing technologies, methylation profiling, and artificial intelligence-driven data integration have markedly improved diagnostic sensitivity and predictive accuracy. Multi-omic frameworks combining genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data enable early detection of resistance, molecular stratification, and identification of actionable targets, while machine learning models enhance outcome prediction and therapy optimization. Despite these advances, key challenges persist. Pre-analytical variability, lack of standardized protocols, and disparities in access continue to limit reproducibility and clinical adoption. High costs, incomplete regulatory validation, and the absence of definitive evidence for mortality reduction underscore the need for larger, prospective trials. Integrating multi-omic assays into clinical workflows will require robust bioinformatics pipelines, clinician-friendly reporting systems, and interdisciplinary collaboration among molecular scientists, data engineers, and oncologists. In the near future, liquid biopsy is expected to complement, not replace, traditional tissue analysis, serving as a cornerstone of adaptive cancer management. As sequencing becomes faster and more affordable, multi-omic and AI-driven analyses will allow earlier detection, more precise treatment adjustments, and continuous monitoring across the disease course. Ultimately, these innovations herald a shift toward real-time, data-driven oncology that personalizes breast cancer care and improves patient outcomes.",2025,Biomedicines,L1_scientific_engagement

Alternative interventions, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), have garnered increasing attention for their potential effectiveness. This narrative review evaluates the efficacy, safety, mechanisms of action, and impact on quality of life of SCS in the management of PDN. A systematic search was conducted covering the last 15 years (from January 2010 to April 2025), using the keywords ""diabetic neuropathy,"" ""spinal cord stimulation,"" ""neuropathic pain,"" and ""neuromodulation"" with Boolean operators. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses involving adult populations and published in English. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Multiple RCTs and observational studies (involving over 500 patients) were identified. RCTs consistently demonstrated that SCS significantly reduces neuropathic pain intensity compared to conventional medical therapy (CMT). The most recent study, with the largest sample size (216 patients), reported that high-frequency SCS achieved ≥50% pain relief in 79% of patients at 6 months, compared to only 5% in the CMT group. Observational studies confirmed sustained pain relief (≥50% reduction) in approximately 55-80% of patients over 5-10 years. Significant improvements in sleep, neurological function, and quality of life were also consistently observed. The complication rate was low, with infections requiring explantation in approximately 2-3% of cases. Rare serious adverse events, such as spinal hematoma, were reported. Current evidence underlines the efficacy and safety of SCS, particularly newer waveform paradigms, for the treatment of PDN refractory to medical management. Given its durable effects on pain relief, functional improvement, and quality of life, SCS should be considered an option within the treatment algorithm for carefully selected patients with severe, refractory PDN.",2025,Biomedicines,L1_scientific_engagement

Beyond cetuximab and PD-1 inhibitors, there are only a few targeted options, which benefit only a minority of patients, underscoring the need for new biomarkers and druggable dependencies. Genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) Cas9 screening now enables systematic, high-specificity investigation of gene function to reveal determinants of tumor proliferation, survival, and therapy response. Compared with RNA interference, CRISPR provides cleaner on-target knockout and more interpretable phenotypes, allowing efficient discovery of essential genes and synthetic-lethal interactions. Although the Cancer Dependency Map profiled 89 OSCC/HNSCC lines to nominate baseline dependencies, drug-perturbed states critical for understanding platinum resistance remain underexplored. Only a handful of HNSCC studies have applied genome-wide CRISPR cas9 screening: two mapped core essential genes; two mapped cisplatin resistance and radiation resistance; and others uncovered synthetic-lethal targets, including vulnerabilities to mTOR inhibition, EGFR inhibition, glutamine metabolism inhibition, and host determinants of oncolytic HSV-1 efficacy. This review synthesizes these findings, highlights methodological considerations (library design, coverage, and treatment duration), and integrates complementary functional data to prioritize targets for rational combinations. This review also provides information on the TCGA database and in vivo CRISPR screening that can accelerate precision therapeutics for patients with HNSCC.",2025,Biomedicines,L1_scientific_engagement

41463011,The Dual Role of RUNX1 in Inflammation-Driven Age-Related Diseases: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Translation.,"Age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegeneration, and metabolic syndrome share a unifying pathological signature-persistent low-grade inflammation or ""inflammaging"". Among the transcriptional regulators that orchestrate this process, RUNX1 has emerged as a pivotal molecular hub linking inflammation, cellular senescence, and tissue dysfunction. Traditionally recognized for its role in hematopoietic lineage specification, RUNX1 is now known to exert context-dependent regulatory functions across diverse organ systems. Its activation in aged tissues is driven by convergent pro-inflammatory and stress-related pathways-including NF-κB, MAPK, JAK/STAT, and oxidative signaling-that reinforce RUNX1 transcriptional activity through epigenetic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling. Sustained RUNX1 upregulation contributes to cellular senescence, fibrotic remodeling, and regenerative blockade, forming a self-perpetuating cycle of ""inflammation amplification-functional decline"". In the cardiovascular, nervous, and hematopoietic systems, aberrant RUNX1 activation underlies fibrosis, neuroinflammation, and clonal hematopoiesis, respectively, establishing RUNX1 as a shared driver of age-associated pathology. The isoform-specific and temporally dynamic regulation of RUNX1 underpins its dual pro- and anti-inflammatory roles, highlighting its translational potential as both a biomarker and therapeutic target. A range of emerging intervention strategies has demonstrated promising capacity to precisely modulate RUNX1 activity. Collectively, these advances position RUNX1 at the intersection of inflammation, epigenetic instability, and tissue degeneration, opening new avenues for targeted intervention in inflammaging and age-related diseases.",2025,Biomedicines,L1_scientific_engagement

This review systematically examines the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving this pathological progression, highlighting the roles of key mutations-such as BRAF, RAS, TERT, and TP53-and the disregulation of signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/AKT. These alterations promote the loss of thyroid-specific functions, including iodide metabolism, and correlate with poor clinical outcomes. In recent years, therapeutic strategies aimed at tumor redifferentiation have emerged as a promising approach for radioiodine-refractory disease. We summarize recent advances in the use of targeted agents, particularly BRAF and MEK inhibitors, to restore radioiodine avidity and improve treatment response. While early clinical studies show encouraging results, including tumor shrinkage and restored RAI uptake in selected patients, challenges such as treatment resistance and patient selection remain. Future efforts should focus on refining molecular stratification, developing rational combination therapies, and integrating novel modalities such as immunotherapy to overcome resistance.

While VEGF-driven vascular permeability is central to its pathogenesis, inflammation plays a complementary and pivotal role in disease progression, morphological heterogeneity, and treatment response. Readily available blood cell-derived inflammatory indices, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-neutrophil ratio (PNR), and pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV), as well as platelet measures (MPV, PDW), have been investigated as low-cost markers of systemic inflammation in DME. Specifically, comparative studies have reported that an NLR ≥ 2.26 can effectively distinguish DME from non-DME with 85% sensitivity and 74% specificity. Elevated NLR is more associated with serous retinal detachment. Moreover, a baseline NLR ≤ 2.32 has been linked to a better anatomical response to treatment. This narrative review summarizes the evidence regarding these biomarkers' diagnostic and prognostic utility and highlights their associations with OCT morphotypes and anti-VEGF responsiveness.

Recent studies indicate that white matter in patients with MS exhibits increased aerobic glycolysis alongside reduced oxygen consumption-a metabolic mismatch between glucose utilization and oxygen consumption-that correlates with disability accumulation. Dysregulated energy metabolism is also a central mechanism limiting remyelination in MS. In MS, this dysregulation is characterized primarily by abnormal availability of metabolic substrates entering the CNS; in turn, it disrupts glucose and lipid metabolism within OLs, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and a diminished capacity for myelin repair. Pharmacological studies employing metabolic intermediates as interventions have shown that correcting energy-metabolism disturbances in OLs can promote remyelination and mitigate MS symptoms, highlighting the metabolic-epigenetic axis as a potential therapeutic target. Clinical and translational research further suggests that modulation of metabolic pathways may enhance remyelination and improve brain energy homeostasis.

41462864,Combined Immunotherapy in Treating Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits a poor prognosis. Immunotherapy has emerged as a major player for both the upfront treatment of advanced HCC and disease progression on prior systemic therapies. In the first-line treatment of advanced HCC, immunotherapy demonstrated superior efficacy outcomes compared to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a favourable safety profile. Initial treatment strategies of single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) yielded only limited clinical activity. A deeper understanding of the hepatic tumour microenvironment and immunotolerance has driven the development of biologically relevant immunotherapy combinations. These combinations, which include antiangiogenic agents or dual ICIs targeting both PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4, are the focus of current research. Recently published clinical trials involving ICI-based combination therapies achieved improved treatment outcomes, continuing to reshape the treatment paradigm for advanced HCC. While different immunotherapy combinations have shown variable efficacy in augmenting anti-tumour immunity, they inevitably increase toxicity and costs. Furthermore, the search for predictive biomarkers remains an unmet challenge in advanced HCC. In this review, we will summarise the notable advances in immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced HCC, discuss the underlying immune microenvironment and rationale for combinations, and explore opportunities for novel therapeutic targets beyond conventional immune checkpoints to overcome immunotherapy resistance.",2025,Biomedicines,L1_scientific_engagement
41462808,Can Glucose Alarm Fatigue Threaten the Absolute Clinical Benefit of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Optimal Glucose Management in Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes? A Narrative Review.,"Technology has brought about a revolution in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump therapy in the everyday life of children and adolescents with T1D is a real innovation and the most promising choice for optimizing glycemic control in this population. The incorporation of an alarm system, including notifications, alerts and alarms and warning patients and their parents about glucose levels and upcoming events interfering with safety, is an invaluable additional tool for better targeting euglycemia. However, in parallel with the clinical benefits of alarm systems in ameliorating metabolic control parameters, alarm fatigue was recorded as a phenomenon, negatively affecting the everyday lives of patients and their caregivers, and as a cause for rejecting or abandoning CGM or pump therapy treatment. There are a few data concerning the frequency, consequences and methods of eliminating alarm fatigue among children. As a result, we have conducted a narrative review to briefly present the basic philosophy of the existing CGM alarm systems and their positive effect on glycemic management, and focus on alarm fatigue; definition, frequency, effect on quality of life and sleep, not only of T1D pediatric patients but also of their families, and methods of elimination. Efforts to achieve a more reliable and accurate alarm system and educate on adapting personalized limits and positively interpreting them may protect the T1D pediatric population from alarm fatigue and prevent rejection or incomplete use of CGM and insulin pump as the therapeutic choice, ensuring the best glycemic control.",2025,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41462800,"Personalized Perioperative Opioid Strategies in Children: Focus on Methadone, Pharmacogenomics and Prevention of Persistent Postoperative Opioid Use.","Persistent postoperative opioid use (PPOU) is an emerging challenge in pediatric perioperative care, with rates as high as 4.7% in opioid-naive adolescents. Despite advances in multimodal analgesia, current protocols often fail to prevent long-term opioid exposure, particularly after high-risk surgeries such as spinal fusions. While multiple strategies exist to reduce PPOU in children, including regional anesthesia and non-opioid analgesics, this review specifically focuses on methadone and pharmacogenomic-guided opioid prescribing as promising approaches. Methadone, a long-acting opioid with mu-opioid agonism, NMDA antagonism, and monoamine reuptake inhibition, has shown encouraging outcomes in adult and emerging pediatric studies but remains underutilized due to concerns over safety, variability, and familiarity. This narrative review explores the intersection of methadone pharmacology, pharmacogenomic (PGx)-guided opioid prescribing, and their potential to reduce PPOU and optimize perioperative pain control in children. We examine methadone's unique pharmacokinetic profile, extended half-life, and ability to reduce central sensitization and opioid tolerance. Data from pediatric trials in cardiac, spinal, and major abdominal surgeries are reviewed, highlighting methadone's potential to lower total opioid use, stabilize postoperative pain trajectories, and improve recovery. The review also discusses the role of PGx testing, particularly CYP2D6, CYP3A4, UGT2B7, and OPRM1 variants, in tailoring methadone dosing to individual metabolic profiles, reducing adverse effects, and improving analgesic efficacy. There are no well accepted generalizable perioperative methadone dose, number of doses and dosing intervals due to limited large multicenter studies in children. We outline challenges, including QTc prolongation, dosing variability, lack of pediatric-specific PGx guidelines, and ethical considerations around genetic testing in minors. The review calls for multidisciplinary perioperative teams, expanded PGx implementation, and real-world data from registries and AI-integrated models to support precision opioid strategies. Preventing PPOU in children is critical. Integration of methadone-based multimodal analgesia in high-risk painful in-patient procedures and future integration of PGx represent positive steps toward personalized, effective, and safer pain management in pediatric surgical patients, an urgent need as opioid stewardship becomes a clinical and public health imperative.",2025,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41462790,Enhancing Engagement and Treatment Efficacy in Youth and Families with Persistent Trauma Exposure.,"Emerging research highlights important distinctions in symptomatology between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) resulting from a single, discrete event, complex interpersonal traumas in the past, and the pervasive effects of chronic, ongoing complex trauma. Despite these well-documented differences, much of the existing practice and professional guidelines for PTSD-focused interventions apply a uniform framework across the distinct clinical presentations resulting from different types and timing of trauma exposure. This gap carries significant clinical consequences, as individuals may be treated for PTSD and comorbid diagnoses or behavioral difficulties without recognition of the impact of persistent ongoing exposure to trauma. The present article is a clinical applications paper that directly builds upon a prior published theoretical and empirical literature review study that introduces the construct of persistent trauma. The objectives are to (1) examine the effects of persistent trauma; (2) explore four types of persistent trauma exposure differentiated by the predictability and preventability of past and current trauma; and (3) offer intervention strategies tailored to each type of persistent trauma. Using a composite case study methodology, we present intervention strategies to inform treatment for children and families who continue to experience each form of persistent trauma.",2025,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

41462697,Effectiveness of Common Extraction Solvents in Obtaining Antioxidant Compounds from African Medicinal Plants.,"The efficacy of phytoextracts is equally affected by the extraction solvent and the extraction method. Details of the solvent type, concentration, density, and other characteristics are associated with the quality of the resultant extract. Some solvents have been found to be effective only on specific parts of plants. Industry has shown a growing interest in eco-friendly plant extracts for the formulation of medication, food additives, cosmetics, and agricultural products. This interest is aligned with the proven necessity of sustainability, marketability, and regulation of manufactured products in value chains. In this review, the literature on antioxidant compounds and activity of extracts from African medicinal plants is reviewed. Findings indicate that the use of ethanol, methanol, water, and to a lesser extent, acetone as solvents for the extraction of antioxidant compounds is common. The use of these solvents is supported by decisive selection of procedure, ideal temperature, duration, solvent pH, and the extracted plant parts. Fermentation enhances the antioxidant activity of aqueous extracts but reduces that of alcohol extracts. This is particularly essential in continents such as Africa, where water is available but alcohol is scarce. ""Green"" extraction technologies are not as successful as solvent extractions for use with African medicinal plants. There is a financial hurdle that results in a mismatch between academic research innovations and societal transmission to new technologies, as most communities are dominated by small-to-medium enterprises. Further studies on the extraction of antioxidants from African medicinal plants are recommended to guide the research and link it to ordinary African societies.",2025,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41462689,Antidiabetic Agents as Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Therapies in Neurological and Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain leading causes of global morbidity and mortality and often coexist, in part through shared mechanisms of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Neuroinflammatory signaling, including microglial activation, cytokine release, and impaired autonomic regulation, contributes to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and stroke, while cardiac and metabolic disturbances can reciprocally exacerbate brain pathology. Increasing evidence shows that several antidiabetic agents exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that extend beyond glycemic control. Metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists modulate key pathways such as AMPK, NF-κB, Nrf2 activation, and NLRP3 inflammasome suppression, with demonstrated vascular and neuroprotective actions in preclinical models. Clinically, GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors reduce major cardiovascular events, improve systemic inflammatory markers, and show emerging signals for cognitive benefit, while metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors exhibit supportive but less robust evidence. This review synthesizes molecular, preclinical, and clinical data across drug classes, with particular emphasis on GLP-1 receptor agonists, and highlights outstanding translational questions including blood-brain barrier penetration, biomarker development, optimal patient selection, and timing of intervention. We propose a unified framework to guide future trials aimed at leveraging antidiabetic therapies such as DDP-4 anti-inflammatory and antioxidant interventions for neurological and cardiovascular diseases.",2025,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41462674,The Redox-Adhesion-Exosome (RAX) Hub in Cancer: Lipid Peroxidation-Driven EMT Plasticity and Ferroptosis Defense with HNE/MDA Signaling and Lipidomic Perspectives.,"Cancer cell plasticity drives metastasis and therapy resistance through dynamic transitions between epithelial, mesenchymal, and neural crest stem-like (NCSC) states; however, a unifying mechanism that stabilizes these transitions remains undefined. To address this gap, we introduce a N-cadherin (CDH2)-centered redox-adhesion-exosome (RAX) hub that links oxidative signaling, adhesion dynamics, and exosome-mediated immune communication into a closed-loop framework. Within this network, reactive oxygen species (ROS) pulses license epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), AXL-FAK/Src signaling consolidates mesenchymal adhesion, and selective exosomal cargoes-including miR-21, miR-200, miR-210, and PD-L1-propagate plasticity and immune evasion. Lipid peroxidation acts as a central checkpoint connecting ROS metabolism to PUFA membrane remodeling and ferroptosis vulnerability, buffered by NRF2-GPX4 and FSP1/DHODH axes, thereby converting transient oxidative pulses into persistent malignant states. Mechanistically, the RAX hub synthesizes findings from EMT/CSC biology, ferroptosis defenses, and exosome research into a self-reinforcing system that sustains tumor heterogeneity and stress resilience. Evidence from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, intravital ROS imaging, and exosome cargo-selector studies supports the feasibility of this model. We further outline validation strategies employing HyPer-EMT-CDH2 tri-reporters, CRISPR perturbation of YBX1/ALIX cargo selectors, and spatial multi-omics in EMT-high tumors. Clinically, tumors enriched in EMT/NCSC programs-such as melanoma, neuroblastoma, small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-represent RAX-dependent contexts. These insights highlight biomarker-guided opportunities to target adhesion switches, ferroptosis defenses, and exosome biogenesis through lipid peroxidation-centered strategies using liquid-biopsy panels (exosomal CDH2, miR-200, miR-210) combined with organoid and xenograft models. By linking lipid peroxidation to ferroptosis defense and oxidative stress adaptation, the RAX hub aligns with the thematic focus of lipid metabolism and redox control in cancer progression. Collectively, the RAX framework may provide a conceptual basis for precision oncology by reframing metastasis and therapy resistance as emergent network properties.",2025,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

(2) This scoping review systematically maps experimental and clinical strategies aimed at preventing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, integrating mechanistic insights across preclinical and translational domains. (3) Preclinical evidence, encompassing in vitro and in vivo studies, delineates three principal mechanistic ways of protection: (A) antioxidant and redox modulation, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), vitamin C, edaravone, and selected phytochemicals, which counteract reactive oxygen species-mediated hair cell apoptosis; (B) mitochondrial stabilization with compounds such as mitoquinone, celastrol, and histone deacetylase inhibitors restoring bioenergetic and proteostatic balance; and (C) restriction of aminoglycoside entry through partial blockade of the mechano-electrical transduction channel, notably by ORC-13661 and related modulators. Additional strategies involve nitric oxide modulation, vasodilatory agents, and iron chelation. Efficacy, however, remains compound- and antibiotic-specific, with paradoxical effects observed for several drugs. Clinical evidence remains limited and methodologically diverse. Of the investigated pharmacologic interventions, aspirin provides the most robust and reproducible evidence of protection against gentamicin-induced hearing loss, whereas NAC demonstrates a consistent, but population-specific benefit among dialysis patients. In contrast, vitamin E-despite promising experimental findings-has failed to show clinically significant otoprotective effects in randomized human studies. (4) In conclusion, while experimental data establish a strong mechanistic basis for pharmacologic otoprotection, clinical studies remain few, underpowered, and methodologically inconsistent. Standardized, adequately powered, and mechanistically informed clinical trials are urgently needed to translate experimental promise into actionable otoprotective strategies.",2025,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement
41462642,Review of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy as an Adjunctive Intervention for Metabolic Disorders.,"Obesity is a chronic systemic disease characterised by insulin resistance, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), which involves the administration of 100% oxygen under elevated atmospheric pressure, has a well-established clinical application in the treatment of non-healing wounds and ischemia, and it is currently being investigated as an adjunctive therapy for obesity and metabolic disorders. The aim of this review is to provide a critical synthesis of recent (2012-2025) evidence regarding the mechanisms of HBOT action in the human body. Furthermore, it examines the metabolic effects and safety profile of HBOT in the context of obesity, with particular attention to experimental and preliminary clinical research. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that HBOT enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces adipose tissue inflammation, and modulates lipid metabolism. The proposed mechanisms include activation of Akt/AMPK signalling and GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle, resulting in improved glucose uptake and oxidation, as well as stimulation of thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. In rodent models of obesity, HBOT has been shown to reduce adipose tissue mass, improve lipid profiles, and restore normal β-oxidation of fatty acids by normalising the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1B in muscle tissue. Preliminary clinical studies in humans indicate that HBOT enhances both systemic and tissue insulin sensitivity, accompanied by improved mitochondrial function and reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress. Despite these promising findings, data on the long-term efficacy, optimal treatment protocols, and safety of HBOT in obese individuals remain limited. In conclusion, HBOT appears to be a promising adjunctive approach in the management of obesity through the multidirectional improvement in metabolic functions. However, high-quality clinical trials are required to confirm its effectiveness, durability of outcomes, and safety profile across diverse patient populations.",2025,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",L1_scientific_engagement

Emerging evidence highlights a synergistic interplay between redox homeostasis and amino acid metabolism in maintaining stemness and treatment resistance. This review integrates redox regulation, amino acid metabolic reprogramming, and tumor microenvironment (TME) signals into a unified ""redox-amino acid-TME"" framework. OCSCs balance signal transduction and antioxidant defense by fine-tuning reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Glutamine, serine/glycine, and sulfur amino acid metabolism collectively generate NADPH and glutathione, sustaining the GPX4/TRX antioxidant systems and suppressing ferroptosis. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-mTOR and tryptophan (Trp)-aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) axes couple amino acid sensing to redox signaling, stabilizing the stem-like phenotype. Under TME stress, including hypoxia, acidity, and nutrient competition, exosomes and stromal components reinforce stemness and immune evasion through metabolic and redox crosstalk. Therapeutically, targeting glutamine metabolism (ASCT2/GLS), serine biosynthesis (PHGDH/SHMT), or antioxidant defenses (xCT/GPX4) disrupts reducing power, increases oxidative stress, and enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy, PARP inhibition, and immunotherapy. Biomarkers such as xCT/GPX4 expression, PHGDH levels, Nrf2 activity, and GSH/NADPH ratios may guide patient stratification and response prediction.

41462597,Expression and Roles of Free Radicals and Reactive Oxygen Species in Hearing Loss.,"Although the etiologies and pathogenesis of common hearing disorders-noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), age-related hearing loss (ARHL), and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL)-are diverse, accumulating evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to hearing loss and that antioxidants may help prevent or treat it. We conducted a literature review to examine the relationship between hearing loss and ROS/free radicals in both humans and animal models. We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar to evaluate the induction and role of ROS in the development and treatment of hearing loss. We synthesized evidence across NIHL, ARHL, and ISSNHL. Factors and reactive species implicated in hearing loss included cytomegalovirus infection, genetic polymorphisms, NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), NOX transgenic models (NOX-Tg), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Antioxidant strategies examined for prevention or treatment included vitamins A, C, and E with magnesium; rebamipide; α-lipoic acid; LLY-283; edaravone; melatonin; glutathione peroxidase; superoxide dismutase; glucose; hydrogen-saturated saline; activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2); inhaled hydrogen gas; and caffeic acid. Elevated ROS and free radicals appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of hearing loss.

41462483,"Challenges and opportunities of human iPSC-derived NK as ""Off-the-shelf"" cellular therapies.","The field of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cell therapies is rapidly advancing, offering a promising ""off-the-shelf"" approach for treating both solid and hematologic malignancies. Among these, hiPSC-derived Natural Killer (NK) cell therapies have gained significant traction, with several currently in clinical trials and development. NK cell-based immunotherapy has emerged as a safe and effective strategy for patients with advanced leukemia, and ongoing research is focused on optimizing its accessibility, scalability, and efficacy. A key advantage of hiPSC-derived NK cells is their genetic susceptibility, allowing for targeted enhancements in fitness, metabolism, specificity, and cytotoxicity. This overcomes the donor-dependent variability that limits autologous and allogeneic NK cell therapies, which often struggle with expansion and functional consistency. Despite their promise, hiPSC-derived NK cells present unique manufacturing challenges, requiring precise optimization to ensure reproducibility, safety, and clinical-grade scalability. In this review, we will explore what we believe to be the most impactful genetic engineering strategies to enhance hiPSC-derived NK cell function. Additionally, we will also discuss the major hurdles challenging widespread clinical adoption, including licensing constraints, production yield, regulatory ambiguities, and the complexities of multi-step genetic engineering and safety validation.

To address the concern, a meta-analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy and safety of brTMS in comparison with unilateral repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (urTMS) or sham repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (srTMS) in treating major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). A systematic search covering publications up to May 22, 2024, was performed across four main bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy and safety of brTMS vs. urTMS or srTMS in patients with MDD or BD. Following Cochrane Handbook guidelines, random-effects meta-analyses were employed to derive pooled estimates for primary and secondary outcomes. The analysis included 20 RCTs (8 comparing brTMS to urTMS, 6 comparing brTMS to srTMS, and 6 comparing brTMS to both urTMS and srTMS), encompassing a total of 1666 participants. No significant difference was observed between brTMS and urTMS regarding study-defined response (9 RCTs, 11 study arms, n = 778; RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.83-1.72; Chi The meta-analysis indicates that brTMS is an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for MDD and BD but does not provide significant antidepressant advantages over urTMS.

41462360,The efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in advanced solid tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The cell surface protein TROP-2 is overexpressed in various solid tumors, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) designed to selectively deliver cytotoxic agents to TROP-2-expressing cancer cells. It has recently been approved for treating unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. While preclinical and early phase clinical trials have shown promising efficacy, this meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy and safety of Dato-DXd in patients with advanced solid tumors by synthesizing the available clinical evidence. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for studies published up to February 18, 2025, that investigated Dato-DXd in advanced solid tumors. The primary outcomes were the overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Data were extracted and pooled for quantitative synthesis. Six studies involving 1,166 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer who received Dato-DXd monotherapy were included. The pooled ORR was 30.0%, and the pooled DCR was 76.9%. The median PFS and OS were 5.56 months and 12.46 months, respectively. The most common TRAEs were stomatitis (all grades: 55.1%, grade ≥ 3: 6.8%), nausea (all grades: 49.4%, grade ≥ 3: 1.3%), and alopecia (all grades: 38.5%, grade ≥ 3: 0.0%).

41462252,Efficacy of antioxidant supplementation in alleviating endometriosis-related pain: insights from a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.,"Endometriosis, a chronic inflammatory disorder, is a leading cause of pelvic pain and reduced quality of life in women, with oxidative stress implicated in its pathogenesis. While antioxidant supplementation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy, its clinical efficacy remains controversial. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the impact of antioxidants on endometriosis-related pain outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and clinical trial registries (2000–January 2025) was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of any oral antioxidant supplement, without dose or duration restrictions, in endometriosis patients and reporting quantitative data on at least one of the primary pain outcomes (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, or chronic pelvic pain). Primary outcomes included dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain. Study risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, and evidence certainty was graded via the GRADE framework. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate pooled effects. Meta-analysis of available RCTs suggested a potential reduction in pain scores for dysmenorrhea (SMD = − 1.26, 95% CI: −2.19 to − 0.32) and chronic pelvic pain (SMD = − 1.07, 95% CI: −1.71 to − 0.42); however, extreme heterogeneity (I² > 90%) in these analyses indicates that these average effects are highly uncertain and should not be generalized specific clinical contexts. No significant effect was observed for dyspareunia. Subgroup analyses indicated that melatonin may be associated with the most consistent potential pain reduction. Current low- to very low-certainty evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation, particularly melatonin, may be associated with improvements in dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain in endometriosis. However, due to considerable inconsistency and methodological limitations across studies, these findings must be interpreted with caution. The results underscore the urgent need for high-quality, large-scale RCTs to confirm any potential benefits and define the clinical role of antioxidants in endometriosis management.

41462250,Sirtuins and regulatory miRNAs as epigenetic determinants of empagliflozin-mediated recovery after acute myocardial infarction.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes, exhibit cardioprotective effects by improving myocardial energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and modulating inflammation and fibrosis, which are critical in the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Our research aims to explore the molecular mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a focus on their influence on non-coding RNAs through sirtuins pathways, to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for preventing heart failure following AMI. We identified microRNAs (miRNAs) that play a role in sirtuin pathways in AMI. We validated the expressions of precisely selected miRNAs along with sirtuin gene expressions (SIRT1-7) in a total of 227 patients with samples from baseline and after 26-week of either placebo or empagliflozin treatment by qRT-PCR. We also performed SHAP analysis of clinical data and miRNAs target predictions and advanced enrichment analyses. Empagliflozin treatment significantly modulated sirtuin and miRNA expression, with higher SIRT6 (p < 0.001) and lower SIRT4 (p = 0.018) expression compared to placebo after 26 weeks.(p (p In contrast, patients in the placebo group showed a reduction in SIRT6 expression (p = 0.006). Patients were divided according to the change in LVEF (ΔLVEF) between baseline and 26-weeks, using a cut-off of 11%. This threshold was derived from the third quartile distribution in the empagliflozin group. Baseline SIRT2 and SIRT4 levels independently predicted a ΔLVEF < 11% improvement (AUC: 0.806 and 0.765, respectively; both p < 0.01), as did miR-182-5p and miR-302a-3p (AUC: 0.716 and 0.757; both p < 0.01). A combined biomarker panel including SIRT2, SIRT4, miR-182-5p, and miR-302a-3p demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for ΔLVEF < 11% after 26-weeks of empagliflozin treatment (cross-validated AUC: 0.890; 81% sensitivity; 90% specificity). This association remained significant after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, BMI, and ezetimibe treatment (OR: 18.70; 95% CI: 5.78-60.49). Importantly, baseline NT-proBNP levels did not significantly predict an unfavorable outcome after 26-weeks of empagliflozin treatment. Baseline levels of SIRT2, SIRT4, miR-182-5p, and miR-302a-3p were identified as predictors of ΔLVEF < 11% changes after 26-weeks of treatment, which suggests their potential for stratifying responders and non-responders to empagliflozin.

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, has demonstrated potential as a multimodal analgesic for reducing opioid consumption and postoperative pain; however, its specific role and efficacy within comprehensive ERAS protocols remain under-evaluated, with variations in dosing and patient response. The current literature lacks a clear consensus on the efficacy of postoperative ketamine infusion for critical ERAS outcomes, including pain control, opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and length of hospital stay. This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of postoperative ketamine infusion on pain, opioid use, and recovery outcomes within ERAS protocols for elective open abdominal surgeries. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by screening PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE up to June 2024. Randomized controlled trials involving adult patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery were included if they compared postoperative ketamine infusion with standard care or placebo within an ERAS setting. The primary outcomes were postoperative pain intensity, measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and opioid consumption, converted to morphine equivalents. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and evidence quality was graded using the GRADE approach. A random-effects model was applied to account for heterogeneity across studies. Fourteen RCTs involving 1067 patients met inclusion criteria. Ketamine significantly reduced postoperative pain scores (standardized mean difference - 0.53, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.22], p < 0.05) and opioid consumption within the first 24 h post-surgery (standardized mean difference - 0.44, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.13], p < 0.05) compared to control treatments. However, effects on PONV and other adverse events were not statistically significant (Log OR -0.19, 95% CI [-0.81, 0.43], p = 0.55), with considerable heterogeneity across studies (I² = 72.69%). Postoperative ketamine infusion within ERAS protocols appears effective in reducing both pain and opioid consumption without significantly impacting PONV or adverse effects. These findings suggest ketamine may be a valuable adjunct in ERAS for elective open abdominal surgeries, though variability in results indicates that optimal dosing and administration strategies require further investigation to maximize patient recovery benefits and minimize side effects.",2025,BMC surgery,L1_scientific_engagement
41462168,Hepatotoxicity and efficacy associated with first- and new-generation EGFR-TKIs in patients with NSCLC: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"While hepatotoxicity has been widely reported with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), the comparative risk among them remains unclear. This study aimed to directly compare the relative risk (RR) of hepatotoxicity between new-generation (afatinib, osimertinib, dacomitinib) and first-generation (gefitinib, erlotinib) EGFR-TKIs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate their overall risk-benefit profile. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library databases and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for trials up to September 2025. A study protocol was registered in PROSPERO: CRD42023457906. Among the 5371 records identified, 6 studies finally fulfilled the established criteria. Data extracted for each study included study characteristics, baseline patient information, interventions and data on all-grades alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TB) elevation, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). RR, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the inverse variance method. Six trials involving 2528 patients were analyzed. Decreased risks of hepatotoxicity due to the elevation of AST and ALT were observed for each new-generation EGFR-TKI. The pooled RRs of all-grades ALT, AST and TB elevation were 0.36 (95% CI 0.24-0.52, P < 0.001), 0.44 (95% CI 0.36-0.54, P < 0.001) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.50-1.39, P = 0.48), respectively. New-generation TKIs did achieved benefit in PFS (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50-0.83, P < 0.0001) and ORR (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.29, P = 0.04). The OS of patients with new-generation TKI treatment was extended (afatinib, HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92, P = 0.008 and osimertinib, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95, P = 0.02), except dacomitinib (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.29, P = 0.81). New-generation EGFR-TKIs (afatinib, osimertinib, and dacomitinib) demonstrate a superior efficacy and safety profile, with a significantly lower risk of hepatotoxicity, compared to gefitinib and erlotinib.",2025,BMC cancer,L1_scientific_engagement
41462163,Efficacy of behaviour change interventions to influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake: a systematic review and behaviour change techniques analysis.,"Behaviour change interventions that increase human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake in school children have been identified, but not which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) make them effective, or whether interventions are best targeted towards adolescents or their parent/carer(s). We aimed to assess the efficacy of behaviour change interventions to increase HPV vaccination compared to usual care according to BCTs implemented, and to identify whether parent/carer(s), adolescents or both are the optimal intervention target population. We searched Central, Embase, Medline and Eric databases from 1st September 2008 to 17th July 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on HPV vaccine uptake following behaviour change interventions. We coded BCTs in interventions using the BCT taxonomy (v1). Random-effects meta-analyses and subgroup analyses were performed with data from studies that provided count data on HPV vaccine uptake by BCTs implemented and intervention target population. One thousand three hundred sixty-three unique records were identified, of which eight were eligible for inclusion. Implementing any behaviour change intervention was associated with a borderline significant increase in HPV vaccine uptake (OR 1.2 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4), interventions that implemented 'Instruction on how to perform the behaviour' (BCT 4.1) and 'Information about health consequences' (BCT 5.1) were not associated with increased HPV vaccine uptake (OR 1.7 95% CI 0.8 to 3.5), but analysis of two interventions implementing 'Adding objects to the environment' (BCT 12.5) in addition showed that this combination may be associated with significantly greater HPV vaccination (OR 13.6 95% CI 3.9 to 46.5). We found that interventions targeting parent/carer(s)-only were associated with a small significant increase in HPV vaccine uptake (OR 1.3 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5), but adolescent-only or parent/carer(s) and adolescent targeted interventions were not. To our knowledge this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the efficacy of behaviour change interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake according to BCTs implemented. We have demonstrated that implementing any behaviour change intervention marginally increases HPV vaccine uptake, and have identified a combination of BCTs that may be associated with significantly increased HPV vaccine uptake. Our work provides compelling evidence that public health interventions must be specific and evidence-based and calls for the implementation of changes to usual care in school-based vaccination programmes.",2025,BMC cancer,L1_scientific_engagement
41462125,Efficacy and safety of letermovir for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplantation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Letermovir (LTV) is a novel antiviral agent approved for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, its efficacy and safety in thoracic organ transplant (TOT) recipients remain underexplored. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy and safety of LTV prophylaxis for CMV infection in TOT recipients. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library was conducted up to February 2025. Studies assessing LTV prophylaxis in adult TOT were included. We performed a single-arm meta-analysis using Open Meta Analyst software and a double-arm meta-analysis with Review Manager. Dichotomous outcomes were pooled as event rates using the fixed-effects model. Eleven studies with 380 patients were included. The single-arm meta-analysis showed that LTV prophylaxis was associated with a 3.7% (95% CI: 0.006, 0.069) breakthrough CMV infection rate. The incidence of low-level CMV viremia was 15.8% (95% CI: 0.070, 0.245). The percentage of patients who discontinued LTV due to adverse effects was only 1.7% (95% CI: -0.002, 0.035), while 79.9% (95% CI: 0.610, 0.988) experienced improvement in leukopenia. The double-arm meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in breakthrough CMV infection rates between LTV and valganciclovir (VGC) (RR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.09, 1.68; P = 0.21). LTV prophylaxis demonstrates promising efficacy and safety in reducing breakthrough CMV infection, low-level viremia, and adverse events in TOT recipients. Its favorable safety profile, particularly in mitigating leukopenia, highlights its potential as an effective alternative to VGC.",2025,BMC infectious diseases,L1_scientific_engagement
41462114,Innovative dual-access surgical strategy for advanced pelvic Fournier's gangrene: a retrospective study assessing combined suprapubic and transsacral debridement.,"Deep-pelvic Fournier's gangrene (FG) spreading via supralevator abscesses is a rare yet clinically challenging condition, often requiring meticulous surgical intervention to ensure adequate drainage while avoiding critical anatomical injury. Although combined suprapubic and transsacral approaches for extraperitoneal compartment access and linked-loop drainage systems represent innovative strategies, their efficacy and outcomes remain underreported. This study aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes of patients with deep-pelvic Fournier gangrene treated using this dual-approach technique. This observational retrospective study included nine patients diagnosed with deep-pelvic FG complicated by extraperitoneal extension across three tertiary medical centers (January 2015-August 2024). Data from nine patients, including age, sex, body mass index, and comorbidities, were extracted and analyzed. All of the patients were successfully drained by the combined suprapubic and transsacral approach. No postoperative morbidity and secondary debridement occurred. During the follow-up period, 3 patients developed anal fistulas, which were subsequently treated with fistulectomy. The combined suprapubic and transsacral approach demonstrated high procedural success and favorable healing outcomes in treating deep-pelvic FG.",2025,BMC gastroenterology,L1_scientific_engagement
41462060,Effects of topically applied liquid N-acetylcysteine for the management of burning mouth syndrome.,"Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) is a chronic neuropathic pain condition with limited treatment options. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol-based antioxidant with neuroprotective properties, has not been clinically evaluated as a topical agent for BMS. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of topically applied liquid NAC in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life of patients with BMS. In a multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized, open-label study, 114 patients with BMS were allocated to receive liquid NAC oral rinse, oral clonazepam, or combination therapy for eight weeks. Symptoms were assessed at baseline, week 4, and week 8 using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Korean version of the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14 K). Across all three groups, VAS scores declined significantly within groups from baseline to week 4 and to week 8; however, the magnitude of VAS change did not differ between groups at either time point. For OHIP‑14 K, significant within‑group decreases were observed in the liquid NAC and combination groups from baseline to weeks 4 and 8, whereas the clonazepam group showed a significant decrease only from week 4 to week 8 and not from baseline. At week 4, the combination group achieved a larger OHIP‑14 K reduction than either monotherapy; by week 8, between‑group differences were no longer significant. Topically applied liquid NAC, alone or in combination with clonazepam, effectively reduced pain and enhanced patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the potential of a localized and safe strategy targeting neuropathic mechanisms in BMS. Topically administered liquid NAC demonstrates potential as an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic strategy for managing BMS, offering symptom relief with minimal systemic burden. Although the combination with clonazepam did not demonstrate sustained superiority at 8 weeks, its principal advantage is a faster onset of improvement in OHIP‑14 K, evident by week 4.",2025,Scientific reports,L1_scientific_engagement

41461973,Natural Anti-Biofilm Agents: A Comprehensive Review and Future Perspectives.,"Biofilms, complex microbial communities embedded in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), pose significant challenges across medical, industrial and environmental sectors due to their enhanced resistance to antibiotics and chemical agents. Traditional treatments often fail to combat biofilm-associated infections, leading to increased healthcare costs and mortality rates. This comprehensive review explores the potential of natural anti-biofilm agents derived from plants, microorganisms, marine organisms and other natural sources as alternative strategies. Plant-derived compounds, microbial products and marine bioactive substances exhibit promising anti-biofilm properties through various mechanisms, including inhibition of microbial adhesion, quorum sensing (QS) interference and EPS disruption. The review highlights the efficacy of these agents in both in vitro and in vivo studies and discusses their potential applications in industries such as medicine, food processing and water treatment. Despite the promising results, challenges such as standardization, biocompatibility and environmental impact remain. Future research should focus on optimizing these natural agents and exploring synergistic combinations to enhance their efficacy. This review underscores the importance of sustainable and interdisciplinary approaches in developing effective, eco-friendly anti-biofilm strategies for diverse applications.",2025,Current microbiology,L1_scientific_engagement
41461960,Subgroup analyses of the phase 3 FOCUS study of melphalan/hepatic delivery system in patients with unresectable metastatic uveal melanoma.,"To assess efficacy and safety in subgroups of patients treated with Melphalan/Hepatic Delivery System (melphalan/HDS), a drug/device combination for liver-directed treatment of metastatic UM (mUM) patients. Previously reported FOCUS study results indicated melphalan/HDS treatment provides a clinically meaningful response rate and favorable benefit-risk ratio in patients with unresectable mUM. Patients with mUM received treatment with melphalan (3.0 mg/kg ideal body weight) every 6-8 weeks for up to 6 cycles. Post hoc analyses of efficacy and safety were conducted for patient subgroups based on demographic and baseline disease characteristics. 102 patients with mUM were enrolled; treatment was attempted in 95 patients; 91 patients received treatment. Subgroup analyses showed consistent tumor response regardless of age, sex, geographic region, presence/absence of extrahepatic lesions, and prior therapy. Patients with lower tumor burden had better objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) than those with higher tumor burden (ORR: 51.1 vs. 22.2%, p = 0.008; mPFS: 11.3 vs. 5.8 months, p = 0.007; mOS: 26.7 vs. 15.4 months, p = 0.008). Patients with 1-25% liver involvement had higher mOS than those with 26-50% liver involvement (22.4 vs. 16.9 months; p = 0.030); patients with low or normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had higher mOS than those with elevated LDH (23.5 vs. 15.3 months; p = 0.019). The overall safety profile was similar across subgroups without evidence of cumulative toxicity with successive treatment cycles. Results demonstrate a favorable benefit-risk profile for melphalan/HDS across clinically relevant subgroups. However, early treatment in patients with low tumor burden may offer best results.",2025,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,L1_scientific_engagement
41461824,"Midwife-led psychoeducational life skills training reduces anxiety, stress, and depression in pregnant adolescents: a randomized trial.","Adolescent pregnancy is associated with elevated stress, anxiety, and depression, often exacerbated by limited social support. Despite the recognized risks faced by pregnant adolescents, there is a paucity of research evaluating the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions specifically integrated into antenatal care for this population. Midwife-led care is widely recognized for its holistic and personalized approach, which is particularly valuable for adolescent mothers. Psychoeducational interventions, enhancements have shown promise in reducing psychological distress and improving well-being among pregnant adolescents. However, evidence remains limited, with few randomized controlled trials evaluating the impact of these interventions when delivered as part of routine childbirth preparation classes. This study aimed to assess the effect of a midwife-led psychoeducational life skills intervention, incorporated into routine childbirth preparation classes, on pregnancy-related anxiety, stress, depression, and perceived social support in pregnant adolescents. This randomized controlled trial involved 90 pregnant adolescents recruited from health centers, with 45 participants assigned to the intervention group and 45 to the control group. The intervention group received ten structured psychoeducational sessions focusing on life skills, delivered by a trained instructor alongside standard childbirth preparation classes. The control group received only routine prenatal education. The control group received routine care only. Outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. Primary outcomes were pregnancy-related anxiety, perceived stress, and depression; the secondary outcome was perceived social support. Data were collected using validated self-report measures at three time points: baseline (pre-intervention), immediately post-intervention, and one month after the intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22, including repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), independent t-tests, and chi-square tests. Ethical approval: IR.AJUMS.REC.1402.140. Trial registration: IRCT20190129042544N1 (26 June 2023). Compared with controls, the intervention group demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety (η² = 0.32, p < 0.001), perceived stress (η² = 0.29, p < 0.001), and depression (η² = 0.31, p < 0.001). Perceived social support increased within both groups, but between-group differences were not significant (p = 0.238). The group × time interaction was statistically significant for anxiety, stress, and depression, compared with the control group, and this effect was maintained at both the 1-month and 3-month follow-up assessments, indicating the sustained efficacy of the midwife-led psychoeducational life skills program. The integration of a psychoeducational life skills program into routine midwife-led antenatal education proved effective in improving the psychological well-being of pregnant adolescents, as evidenced by significant reductions in anxiety, stress, and depression. These findings support the inclusion of structured psychoeducational interventions in adolescent maternity care services to promote mental health during pregnancy. While both the intervention and control groups experienced increased perceived social support, the lack of a significant between-group difference suggests that additional or alternative strategies may be needed to further enhance social support outcomes in this population.Trial registration: The study protocol was prospectively registered in the Iranian Registry for Randomized Controlled Trials on 26 June 2023 (registration number: IRCT20190129042544N1), and participant recruitment began on October 1, 2024.",2025,Scientific reports,L1_scientific_engagement

The literature search strategy involved structured searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from January 2013 to March 2025. The risk of bias was assessed using ROB 2.0. Descriptive analysis and meta-analysis were performed. Forest plots and the node-splitting model presented results. Network meta-analysis was conducted in R 4.3.2. 33 studies(n = 2538) were included in this review and of those, 27 studies(n = 2106) were used for meta-analysis. 22 (66.7%) studies were at high risk of bias and the certainty of evidence for all outcomes (6MWT, dyspnea, HRQoL) was rated as low due to study limitations and imprecision. Compared with usual care, PR patients have significant improvement on 6MWT as well as mMRC (both P < 0.01). The cumulative ranking probability curves and forest plot analyses revealed a hierarchical efficacy profile among rehabilitation modalities for CRDs, with outpatient presented the larger effects on mMRC (mean difference (MD)= -0.82, 95%Cl [-1.45, -0.19]), 6MWT(MD = 65.45, 95%Cl [45.06, 85.84]). Our findings suggest that PR probably improves exercise capacity and reduces dyspnea in patients with CRDs, with outpatient-based programmes generally showing the largest effects, while the high risk of bias limits interpretation of this finding.PROSPERO ID: CRD420251013615.",2025,NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,L1_scientific_engagement

Combination chemotherapy is usually recommended for this disease. Recently, 2 nitroimidazole-based agents, namely, delamanid and pretomanid, have been approved by regulatory agencies. JDB0131 is a novel, structurally optimized third-generation nitroimidazole antituberculosis agent that incorporates the advantages of earlier compounds. This multicenter, prospective, randomized phase 2a trial was conducted to evaluate its efficacy and safety in patients with tuberculosis (NCT06224036). In total, 52 patients with newly diagnosed TB were recruited. JDB0131 was tested in a dose escalation manner (cohort 1: 100 mg bid, cohort 2: 200 mg qd, and cohort 3: 200 mg bid). For comparison, delamanid (100 mg bid) and classic fixed-dose combination (FDC) regimens were included as controls. The primary endpoint was logarithmic changes in the number of colony formation units (CFUs) in the solid media culture of sputum TB (log10 CFU). The early bactericidal activity (EBA) of JDB0131 was better than that of delamanid. During the time interval between days 0 and 14, JDB0131 at a dose of 200 mg bid (cohort 3) showed superior efficacy over delamanid. At the end of drug intervention (day 14), JDB0131 (all 3 dose levels) achieved superior time to positivity (TTP) over delamanid. Ninety-one adverse events (AEs), including no serious AEs, were attributed to JDB0131 in 30 patients.

41461600,Molecular Mimicry at the Gut-Immune Interface: A Mechanistic Link to Type 1 Diabetes.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) arises from T cell-mediated destruction of pancreatic β-cells. However, genetic susceptibility alone cannot account for the increasing incidence and earlier onset of T1D, suggesting a substantial contribution from environmental factors, particularly the gut microbiota. This review synthesises recent human, multiomics and experimental evidence linking gut microbiota dysbiosis and microbial metabolites to β-cell autoimmunity. We focus on two converging mechanisms: (1) metabolite-driven disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and immune regulation, and (2) molecular mimicry between microbial peptides and islet autoantigens that activate autoreactive T cells. Across human cohorts and animal models, T1D-associated dysbiosis features reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Roseburia) and increased pro-inflammatory taxa (e.g., Bacteroides, Streptococcus spp.). SCFA deficiency compromises Treg induction and gut barrier stability, facilitating antigen translocation. Several gut-derived peptides, such as the Parabacteroides distasonis hprt4-18 peptide, share sequence homology with insulin and other islet antigens, activate insulin-reactive T cells and accelerate diabetes in NOD mice, supporting a role for molecular mimicry. Interventional approaches including FMT, probiotics and prebiotics show promise but remain heterogeneous; their efficacy is highly strain-, timing- and context-dependent and translation from animal studies to humans is still limited. Therapeutically targeting the gut-islet axis, through modulation of microbiota, microbial metabolites or cross-reactive antigens, offers potential for disease prevention or adjunctive treatment. We highlight emerging biomarkers, including MAIT-cell phenotypes, antimicrobial peptide reactivity and microbiome-derived functional signatures, and emphasise the need for stratified clinical trial designs based on age, genotype and baseline microbiota composition to address current variability. The microbiota-metabolite-molecular mimicry axis provides a coherent mechanistic framework linking gut dysbiosis to T1D pathogenesis. Advancing these insights into clinical application will require rigorous, genotype-stratified human studies and standardised, transparent methodological approaches.",2025,Immunology,L1_scientific_engagement
41461561,[Research progress on serum chitinase-3-like protein 1 for diagnosing early-stage liver fibrosis non-invasively].,"Liver fibrosis is a pathological change caused by hepatocyte inflammation and necrosis due to various etiologies, leading to excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it can progress to liver cirrhosis or even cancer if not detected and treated in a timely manner. Therefore, early-stage diagnosis and timely intervention are of great significance for the prevention of liver cirrhosis and cancer. In recent years, the non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis still has certain limitations, hence an ideal non-invasive diagnostic method for early-stage remains a research hotspot. Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) is a member of the chitinase family, encoded by the human CHI3L1 gene, which is highly expressed in the liver, playing an important role in various inflammatory and fibrotic disease processes with its secretion as a glycoprotein with cytokine and growth factor properties. Recent studies have shown that serum CHI3L1, as an emerging biomarker, has been widely used in the screening and diagnosis of liver-related diseases. This paper reviews the role of serum CHI3L1 in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis non-invasively and its relationship with the staging of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancer, providing references for clinical treatment. 肝纤维化是由各种病因引起的肝细胞炎症和坏死从而导致细胞外基质过度沉积的病理性变化。肝纤维化如发现和治疗不及时，将进展为肝硬化甚至肝癌。因此，肝纤维化的早期诊断和及时干预治疗对预防肝硬化与肝癌具有重要意义。近年来，肝纤维化的无创诊断仍存在一定局限性，理想的早期无创诊断方法仍是研究热点。壳多糖酶3样蛋白1（CHI3L1）属于壳多糖酶家族的成员，是由人类",2025,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,L1_scientific_engagement

This review consolidates recent advances in NE formulation, encompassing both high-energy and low-energy preparation techniques. Summarizes the key physicochemical parameters that influence stability and bioactivity. Special attention is given to plant-derived active compounds encapsulated in NEs, their modes of action against M. oryzae, and their performance in laboratory and field trials. The comparative advantages of NEs over conventional fungicides, their integration into rice blast management strategies, and the technical and regulatory hurdles to wider adoption are discussed.

41461310,"Targeting the human gut microbiome: a comparative review of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics.","The human gut microbiome plays a central role in regulating host health, serving as a core hub for systemic physiological interactions. Dysregulation of the gut microbiome is implicated in a wide spectrum of local and systemic diseases. Research has evolved from establishing associations to elucidating the mechanistic roles of gut microbes and developing targeted strategies for their modulation, with a growing emphasis on their bidirectional communication with other organ systems. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the composition and function of the gut microbiome, its functional crosstalk with the host, and its integral role in both health and disease. A major focus is placed on critically evaluating the mechanisms, efficacy, and applications of key microbiome-directed interventions-probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics-in maintaining or restoring gut-centric ecological balance. The gut microbiome acts as a dynamic microbial organ essential for digestion, immune maturation, and metabolic homeostasis. Dysbiosis, characterized by a loss of beneficial microbes and an overgrowth of potential pathogens, is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic diseases, and other systemic conditions. The gut microbiome engages in continuous bidirectional communication with distant organs, including the oral cavity, lungs, skin, and urinary tract, via specific axes (e.g., gut-oral, gut-lung, gut-skin), thereby exerting widespread influence on host physiology. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics represent complementary strategies to counteract dysbiosis and reestablish gut ecological integrity, ranging from introducing live beneficial bacteria to utilizing inactivated microbial cells and their bioactive metabolites. Enhancing the translational potential of these interventions requires deeper mechanistic insights and robust clinical validation.",2025,Journal of advanced research,L1_scientific_engagement
41461304,Challenges to malaria vaccine availability and successful implementation of malaria vaccine program in Africa.,"The approval of malaria vaccines was a significant milestone towards malaria eradication in Africa which bear the major burden of the disease. Ensuring availability and access to these vaccines across Africa however, presents complex challenges that limit their immediate impact. This review looks at the main obstacles to malaria vaccine availability and successful implementation of malaria vaccine program in Africa using academic and health databases. Supply constraints appear to be the major factor, as the current manufacturing capacity was insufficient to meet the high demand across endemic regions in Africa. Moreover, vaccine coverage in Africa is also impacted by limited national health budget that pose constraints to acquire, transport, store and conduct immunization activities. Lack of confidence in healthcare system, misinformation and conspiracy theory about vaccine efficacy and safety frequently propagated through social networks, community and religious leaders greatly affect public confidence about vaccine in societies where past experiences with Western-led health initiatives have led many to question new interventions. Programmatic and logistical hurdles, such as cold chain requirements and multiple-dose schedules further complicate delivery in remote area while shortages in skilled health workers and weak pharmacovigilance systems limit programme effectiveness. Finally, inequities in allocation risk leaving high-burden but resource-constrained regions underserved. Addressing these challenges require coordinated global and regional action, including scaling up manufacturing capacity, continuous research to enhance vaccine effectiveness, stable funding for production and distribution, strengthening health systems and fostering community trust to ensure that the potential of malaria vaccines to eliminate malaria from Africa is achieved.",2025,Acta tropica,L1_scientific_engagement
41461213,Progress of anti-tumor research on natural products combined with doxorubicin.,"Cancer represents a major global public health challenge, with its incidence and mortality rates increasing annually. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Despite its marked antitumor efficacy, the clinical application of DOX is limited by drug resistance and cumulative toxicity. Numerous natural products have garnered significant attention owing to their favorable antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties, and are increasingly being developed as adjuvant agents in combination therapy with DOX. The co-administration of natural products with DOX has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance therapeutic outcomes while mitigating adverse effects. However, this combination approach is constrained by poor drug solubility and disparate pharmacokinetic profiles. The advent of multifunctional nanodelivery systems has improved drug bioavailability and tumor targeting, thereby laying the groundwork for synergistic interactions between natural products and DOX. This review systematically summarizes the antitumor mechanisms and toxic side effects of DOX, elucidates the mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships of certain natural products serving as DOX sensitizers and protective agents, and highlights recent advances in nano-platform-based co-delivery strategies, offering valuable insights for future cancer therapeutics.",2025,Fitoterapia,L1_scientific_engagement
41461112,Effectiveness of Mobile Health-Based Self-Management Programs on Health-Related Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leads to increased morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for effective self-management. Challenges such as accessibility, cost, and patient engagement hinder self-management efforts, underscoring the need for evidence-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions. This meta-analysis evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of mHealth self-management programs for COPD, focusing on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, the 6-minute walking test (6MWT), and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score. The secondary outcomes include quality-adjusted life years and costs as economic outcomes; exacerbation, hospitalization, and emergency room and clinic visits as clinical outcomes; and self-efficacy as a humanistic outcome. The inclusion criteria encompassed RCTs involving patients with COPD aged 18 years and older, comparing mHealth-based self-management programs to non-mHealth interventions, with outcomes measured using the mMRC dyspnea scale, 6MWT, and SGRQ score. Exclusion criteria included observational studies, reviews, qualitative research, protocols, and non-English publications. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus using predefined keywords and MeSH terms for studies published between January 2015 and September 2024. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool. Data extraction encompassed study characteristics, interventions, comparators, and outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for outcomes reported in at least 3 RCTs using R software (version 4.2.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). This systematic review included 36 RCTs from diverse geographical regions, encompassing 5606 patients. The meta-analysis revealed significant improvements in the mMRC dyspnea scale (mean difference -0.65, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.16; P=.02) and 6MWT (mean difference 25.96 m, 95% CI 10.05 m to 41.87 m; P=.004) in the mHealth intervention group compared to controls. However, no statistical significance was observed in the SGRQ total score (mean difference -3.56, 95% CI -7.39 to 0.27; P=.07). A total of 2 studies reported economic results, with a possible statistically significant decrease in the mean cost per patient (€3547 vs €4831 [US $4118.4 vs US $5609.24]; P=.01), but no statistically significant difference in quality-adjusted life years (0.485 vs 0.491; P=.73). A total of 5 studies reported substantial reductions in hospital admissions. Additionally, 1 study each reported significant improvements in time to first readmission for COPD exacerbations, clinic visits, mortality rates, and exacerbation frequencies. A single study reported a significant improvement in self-efficacy, as measured by the Pulmonary Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy scores. This review supports the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2025 recommendations, highlighting mHealth as a supplementary clinical tool requiring patient education, ethical compliance, and informed consent. Further large-scale studies are needed to refine mHealth tools, ensuring accessibility, long-term safety, and effectiveness across diverse populations and outcome domains.",2025,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,L1_scientific_engagement
41461066,Digital Health Technologies Applied in Patients With Early Cognitive Change: Scoping Review.,"Digital health technologies (DHTs) have the potential to revolutionize the screening, diagnostic support, monitoring, and intervention for early cognitive change. However, the full spectrum of their application and the existing evidence base in this specific patient population have not been systematically delineated. This study aimed to review and synthesize the applications, roles, and challenges of DHTs in patients with early cognitive change. This scoping review was conducted in accordance with established methodological frameworks for scoping reviews and followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) and PRISMA-S (PRISMA Statement for Reporting Literature Searches in Systematic Reviews) guidelines. A systematic search was conducted across 5 electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, APA PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. The search covered the period from each database's inception until September 30, 2025. Studies were selected, and data were extracted using the population-concept-context framework, focusing on digital health interventions for patients with early cognitive change. This scoping review identified 193 studies (from 8346 initial articles, screened down to 5623 after deduplication) evaluating DHTs for early cognitive change, with a marked publication surge post 2020. Studies predominantly focused on mild cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive decline. Among the 170 studies that reported the age of participants, the mean age of the participants was 74.09 (SD 7.98) years. Furthermore, six categories of DHTs emerged: (1) artificial intelligence or big data, (2) internet of things, (3) virtual reality or augmented reality, (4) robotics, (5) mobile apps or computerized cognitive training, and (6) telemedicine. Outcomes most frequently assessed included cognitive function, mental health, and feasibility. Notably, only 23 studies measured quality of life, with limited long-term (6-12 months) follow-up. Physiological markers, social support, sleep quality, and self-efficacy were explored but less frequently. DHTs demonstrate significant potential in the management of patients with early cognitive impairment, particularly playing crucial roles in screening, intervention, monitoring, and auxiliary diagnosis. This scoping review underscores that DHTs, through personalized interventions and continuous care, can effectively improve patient outcomes while innovatively incorporating the caregiver perspective. However, their practical application faces challenges in balancing technological complexity with user-friendliness. Future research needs to address five key issues: (1) the lack of long-term efficacy evidence, (2) insufficient coverage of individuals with subjective cognitive decline and caregiver populations, (3) a dearth of empirical evidence on the combined application of multiple DHTs, (4) the failure of personalized programs to fully account for individual differences, and (5) the absence of effective solutions to address data and ethical risks. There is an urgent need to establish a long-term efficacy evaluation system for DHTs through rigorous methodological validation.",2025,Journal of medical Internet research,L1_scientific_engagement
41461040,Trastuzumab deruxtecan and the evolving role of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates in breast and ovarian cancer.,"Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. One of the most significant advances in treatment has been the evolution of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies. This review summarizes recent clinical progress in HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), with specific focus on trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in breast and ovarian cancer, and highlights emerging ADCs shaping the next generation of HER2-targeted therapy. T-DXd has demonstrated superior efficacy to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in breast cancer across the metastatic and adjuvant settings, and has also shown significant activity in HER2-low and ultralow disease. Mechanistic innovations, including a cleavable linker, a high drug-to-antibody ratio, and a membrane-permeable topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, enhance its potency. In ovarian cancer, T-DXd has shown promising early efficacy in heavily pretreated patients; however, additional real-world data are needed to better define its clinical benefit and optimize patient selection. Emerging HER2-directed ADCs such as disitamab vedotin aim to overcome resistance and broaden therapeutic options for patients. The efficacy of T-DXd represents a major advance in HER2-targeted therapy, expanding treatment beyond HER2-positive disease into a wider continuum of HER2 expression. Ongoing clinical development of next-generation ADCs aims to improve efficacy, safety, and access to precision-guided cytotoxic therapy across solid tumors.",2026,Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,L1_scientific_engagement
41460893,Optimized therapeutic drug monitoring: the role of machine learning models.,"Traditional therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) faces limitations in accuracy and adaptability, often failing to optimize therapy for complex patients. Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful tool to overcome these challenges, offering a data-driven paradigm to enhance therapeutic outcomes and minimize toxicity for drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. This review synthesizes the evolution of ML in TDM. We cover foundational models that predict drug exposure from sparse data using either real-world or simulation-based training. We then explore the extension of these techniques to proactive first-dose optimization and the recent development of hybrid models, which integrate the physiological interpretability of population pharmacokinetic frameworks with the corrective power of ML. The future of TDM lies not in replacing mechanistic models, but in their convergence with ML. While promising, clinical translation requires overcoming critical barriers in data access, model interpretability, and workflow integration. The long-term trajectory points toward dynamic Digital Twins capable of forecasting patient-specific benefit-risk profiles. Ultimately, validated hybrid tools embedded in clinical decision support systems could establish proactive, individualized dosing as the new standard of care in personalized pharmacotherapy.",2025,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,L1_scientific_engagement
41460824,Obesity and cathepsin S in periodontal health and disease: A prospective clinical observational study.,"This study aimed to evaluate the association between obesity, periodontal status, and cathepsin S (CatS) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and saliva and assess the impact of obesity on clinical and biochemical outcomes following nonsurgical periodontal therapy (NSPT). A total of 52 participants were categorized into nonobese with periodontal health, obese with periodontal health, nonobese with periodontitis, and obese with periodontitis groups. Clinical, periodontal, and anthropometric measurements were recorded. CatS levels in GCF and saliva were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NSPT was performed in the periodontitis groups, and clinical and biochemical parameters were re-evaluated after 3 months. GCF and salivary CatS levels were highest in the obese periodontitis group and lowest in the nonobese periodontal health group (p < 0.001). Regression analysis revealed a significant positive association between body mass index (BMI), GCF, salivary CatS levels, and plaque index (p < 0.05). Significant positive correlations were observed between BMI and CatS levels, as well as between CatS levels and clinical periodontal parameters (p < 0.001). Following NSPT, both periodontitis groups exhibited significant clinical and biochemical improvement (p < 0.05). However, reductions in bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss, and salivary CatS levels were significantly greater in the nonobese periodontitis group than in the obese group (p < 0.001). Periodontitis and obesity are associated with elevated CatS levels in GCF and saliva. Obesity may negatively impact clinical responses to NSPT. CatS could serve as a potential biomarker linking obesity to periodontitis and NSPT outcomes.",2025,Acta odontologica Scandinavica,L1_scientific_engagement
41460741,A Case of Cardiac Sarcoidosis Presenting with a Low-level Elevation of Troponin: Case Report and Literature Review.,"Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is a rare complication of systemic sarcoidosis, which can occur independently or concurrently with systemic sarcoidosis. The clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic myocardial granulomas to arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic sudden death, significantly increasing the mortality rate associated with sarcoidosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of CS is crucial, especially for patients with limited symptoms of systemic sarcoidosis. In patients with confirmed systemic sarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) frequently exhibits a clinically silent phenotype, typically manifesting several years subsequent to the initial onset of systemic sarcoidosis manifestations. To date, no definitive evidence substantiates the utility of serum biomarkers for CS screening, and data regarding their efficacy in CS diagnosis and clinical management remain limited. We report a case of an asymptomatic, untreated patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis, who repeatedly had mild elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T(hs-cTnT), with no abnormalities in electrocardiogram or echocardiography. Eventually, Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) examination confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis, and the patient's indicators improved after immunosuppressant treatment. We conducted a literature search to evaluate the effectiveness of hs-cTnT as a screening tool for CS, providing a reference for the management of CS in clinical practice.",2025,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,L1_scientific_engagement
41460655,"Exploring the gut-brain-microbiome axis in Alzheimer's disease: Integrating metagenomics, metabolomics, and artificial intelligence for next-generation biomarker discovery.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is increasingly understood as a multifactorial condition influenced by systemic and environmental factors beyond the central nervous system. A growing body of evidence shows that the gut-brain-microbiome axis (GBMA), a complex bidirectional communication network, is involved in neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways in AD pathogenesis. This narrative review synthesizes emerging insights into the role of gut microbiota dysbiosis in promoting neuroinflammation, amyloid-β aggregation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and cognitive decline. We explored recent advancements in metagenomics and metabolomics for profiling microbial communities and their functional metabolites linked to AD. Alterations in microbe-derived compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids and tryptophan metabolites, influence neurodevelopment, glial activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Multi-omics integration, enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI), enables precise biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. Translational opportunities include microbiome-based diagnostics, probiotic therapy, and stratified interventions. However, clinical translation faces challenges such as methodological heterogeneity, inter-individual microbiome variation, data governance issues, and algorithmic bias. We emphasize the need for diverse reference panels, longitudinal multimodal cohorts, and shared AI-ready datasets to enhance the reproducibility and global equity of research. Strategic investment in integrative, ethically governed, and interdisciplinary approaches is essential to unlock the full therapeutic and diagnostic potential of GBMA in AD.",2025,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,L1_scientific_engagement
41460610,Comparative Efficacy of Combined and Standalone Oral Immunotherapies for Peanut Allergy: a Bayesian Network Meta-Analysis of RCTs.,"Peanut allergy is a chronic IgE-mediated disease with potentially life-threatening consequences. While several immunotherapeutic strategies have emerged, including oral immunotherapy (OIT), omalizumab (OMA)-based therapies, and probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy (PPOIT), the comparative effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of combined and standalone oral immunotherapies for peanut allergy using a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA). A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to March 2025. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with IgE-mediated peanut allergy who received OIT + OMA, OMA monotherapy, OIT alone, or PPOIT. Outcomes included low-dose and high-dose desensitization, sustained unresponsiveness (SU), and safety outcomes (adverse events, AEs). The risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2. Analyses were performed using R software (version 4.4.3) with Bayesian NMA methods. Nineteen RCTs involving 2040 participants were included. Based on Probability Scores (P-scores), OIT + OMA demonstrated the highest efficacy for both low- (P-score: 97.20%) and high-dose desensitization (96.69%), followed by PPOIT (70.15% and 51.16%), OIT third (64.40% and 52.72%), and OMA fourth (75.29% and 71.21%). PPOIT and OIT showed moderate efficacy for SU. OIT was associated with a higher frequency of AEs compared with placebo. Combination and modified immunotherapies may offer improved efficacy and safety profiles, though results should be interpreted in the context of limited data and study heterogeneity.",2025,Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,L1_scientific_engagement

Blood biomarkers present a scalable, accessible, and resource-efficient diagnostic alternative.ObjectiveTo investigate the diagnostic and differential diagnostic performance of three clinically relevant plasma biomarkers: phosphorylated tau-217 (pTau217), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) for biologically confirmed AD patients in real-world, clinical settings.MethodsA systematic search was conducted across 5 databases for peer-reviewed studies between January 2019-January 2025. A narrative synthesis was conducted for eligible studies.Results13 studies (n = 4686 participants) were included. All studies were cross-sectional, and investigated populations recruited from memory clinics, neurology departments, or clinical cohorts. Diagnostic performance of pTau217 was consistently high (AUC > 0.90 across all comparisons). GFAP showed stronger and more consistent diagnostic performance as compared to NfL, though both demonstrated moderate and variable accuracy (AUCs ranging from <0.75 to >0.90). No studies assessed combinations of all 3 biomarkers. Methodological and assay heterogeneity was common.ConclusionsPlasma pTau217 demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy and promise for diagnosis of AD. GFAP and NfL displayed inconsistent results, but could provide complementary information, particularly for differential diagnosis.

41460537,Polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria: a comprehensive review with a focus on the role of 4-amino-4-doexy-L-arabinose.,"Polymyxin resistance among Gram-negative bacteria poses a serious global health threat by limiting treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections. This review summarizes current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying polymyxin resistance, with a particular focus on the role of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (L-Ara4N) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) modification. We discuss the regulation of L-Ara4N biosynthesis and transfer by two-component systems such as PmrAB, PhoPQ, CrrAB, CprRS, ColRS, and ParRS, which mediate bacterial responses to environmental stimuli. Furthermore, we synthesize recent findings on combination therapies designed to restore polymyxin efficacy, including agents such as natural polyphenols, antimicrobial peptides, and secondary metabolites. Special attention is given to emerging strategies targeting ArnT, including inhibitors with ent-beyerane skeletons (e.g., BBN149 from Fabiana densa var. ramulosa). Finally, this review highlights ongoing challenges related to polymyxin toxicity and underscores the need for future research aimed at optimizing dosing strategies and reducing adverse effects. By integrating findings across multiple studies, this review provides an updated overview of current approaches to counteract polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.",2025,Molecular biology reports,L1_scientific_engagement
41460448,VPS9D1-AS1: a critical oncogenic long non-coding RNA in human malignancies.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exceeding 200 nucleotides participate in the physiological and pathological pathways of various cancers. VPS9D1 antisense RNA 1 (VPS9D1-AS1), situated in the q24.3 region of human chromosome 16 and known as c-Myc upregulation factor (MYU), is upregulated in multiple tumor types. This lncRNA mainly plays a cancer-promotional role by modulating target genes, adsorbing microRNAs (miRNAs), and involving in the regulation of numerous pivotal signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β/ISG, and PI3K/AKT. Collectively, these molecular mechanisms promote malignant phenotypes, including proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. Clinical studies have indicated that high expression levels of VPS9D1-AS1 are closely associated with tumor volume enlargement, progression in clinical staging, increased risk of metastasis, and poor prognosis. This review systematically elucidates the role, molecular mechanisms, and clinical application value of VPS9D1-AS1 in malignant tumors, emphasizing its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",2025,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,L1_scientific_engagement
41460419,Comparative meta-analysis of perioperative outcomes following robot-assisted renal surgery: KangDuo versus Da Vinci systems.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of perioperative outcomes of the KangDuo Surgical Robot System versus the Da Vinci System in robot-assisted renal surgery. We conducted a comprehensive systematic search in key databases including PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science, encompassing studies in all languages, with the final search date being October 2025. We also excluded articles comprising reviews, letters, and single-arm studies. Variables were assessed using metrics of Weighted Mean Difference (WMD), Standardized Mean Difference (SMD), and Odds Ratio (OR). The statistical synthesis of the data, encompassing diverse outcome measures, was conducted utilizing the Review Manager software. Moreover, the protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis is publicly available on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD420251181530). In a pooled analysis of 370 participants from five trials, the KangDuo Surgical Robot System demonstrated a significantly extended docking time relative to the Da Vinci System (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.21-1.90; p < 0.00001). Conversely, comparisons of operative time, estimated blood loss, incidence of minor complications, ischemia time, and postoperative renal function (assessed by 4-week serum creatinine and eGFR) yielded comparable results, with no statistically significant differences. In this meta-analysis with limited sample size, geographic focus on Chinese centers, and short-term follow-up, the pooled data indicate that the KangDuo (KD) Surgical Robot System achieved non-inferiority to the Da Vinci System on several key perioperative metrics in robot-assisted renal surgery, although with a longer docking time. These findings support the KD system as a promising alternative in comparable settings, yet they should be interpreted within the constraints of the available evidence. Future research, particularly large-scale, multicenter randomized trials with long-term monitoring of survival and renal function, is necessary to confirm its efficacy and safety profile for widespread clinical adoption.",2025,Journal of robotic surgery,L1_scientific_engagement

41460396,Perioperative safety and efficacy of minimally invasive vs. open thymectomy for large thymomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study aims to systematically examine how minimally invasive thymectomy-covering both video-assisted and robotic-assisted methods-compares with open thymectomy in terms of perioperative safety and effectiveness for treating large thymomas. We thoroughly searched several databases for relevant studies, including randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, published up until October 2025. Data on perioperative factors, including surgical duration, blood loss, length of hospitalization, complications, and recurrence rates, were extracted and analyzed using random-effects models in STATA 18. Seven studies involving 12,880 patients were included. open surgery showed significantly more blood loss (WMD = 110.43, 95% CI 105.83-115.03; P < 0.05), longer hospital stays (WMD = 2.04, 95% CI 1.38-2.7; P < 0.05) compared to MIT. No notable difference in surgical duration was observed. Moreover, minimally invasive thymectomy (MIT) was associated with a reduced rate of recurrence after surgery (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.84; P < 0.05) as well as fewer postoperative complications (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39; P < 0.05). MIT offers significant advantages over open surgery for large thymomas, including reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and lower rates of complications and recurrence, though operative time was similar.

41460384,Extent of resection and adjuvant treatment in adult cerebellar glioblastoma: systematic review and meta-analysis of survival outcomes.,"Cerebellar glioblastoma (cGBM) is a rare subtype, comprising of < 1% of patients with GBMs. This study sought to identify predictors of survival for patients with cGBM through an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, focusing on the impact of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and extent of resection (EOR). Following PRISMA-IPD guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and Individual Patient Data (IPD) meta-analysis of 13 retrospective studies (113 adults) with IDH-wildtype cerebellar glioblastoma. Variables included demographics, tumor location, KPS, MGMT, TP53, extent of resection (GTR, STR, PR, biopsy), and CRT. Kaplan-Meier estimated OS and PFS; unadjusted and adjusted Cox models assessed predictors. Hazard ratios for CRT vs. monotherapy and GTR vs. incomplete resection were pooled in a two-stage random-effects model (Hartung-Knapp). Analyses used R (v4.4.2) and JMP Pro 17. Mean age was 54.9 years; 64% were male. GTR was performed in 37%, PR in 43%, STR in 11%, and biopsy in 10%. CRT was associated with improved OS (18 vs. 7 months; p = 0.02) and PFS (12 vs. 2.5 months; p = 0.0205) compared to monotherapy on Kaplan-Meier analysis. Two-stage IPD meta-analysis showed a 72% reduced risk of death with CRT (HR 0.28; 95% CI: 0.15-0.51; p = 0.0119), with similar significance in one-stage unadjusted Cox models (HR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.26-0.91; p = 0.0233). EOR comparisons were non-significant in meta-analyses, though GTR vs. biopsy showed early separation on Wilcoxon testing (p = 0.0422). In this pooled IPD meta-analysis of cGBM, the use of CRT remained the only consistent and independent predictor of improved survival. GTR conferred a survival advantage over biopsy, likely reflecting the clinical benefit of debulking, however its advantage over subtotal resection was not statistically significant. These findings reinforce CRT as the maintstay of treatment highlighting the need for individualized strategies in cGBM. In selected cGBM patients, gross total surgical resection and adjuvant chemo-RT result in overall survival outcomes comparable with supratentorial GBM.
